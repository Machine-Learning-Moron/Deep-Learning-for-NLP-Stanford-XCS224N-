However, the method of the above-mentioned (1) is difficult to handle because phosgene has toxicity.. The method of the above-mentioned (2) requires a catalyst for accelerating the thermal decomposition because the thermal decomposition rate of the carbamate compound is very slow. When such a catalyst is used, it becomes necessary to carry out an operation of separating the catalyst after obtaining the target isocyanate compound. However, this poses problems such that, for example, the separation operation is not easy, and the amount of the target compound formed per unit mass of the catalyst is small.. The method of the above-mentioned (3) can provide a non aromatic carbamate compound without using a catalyst, but the conversion of the obtained non aromatic carbamate compound into an isocyanate compound still requires a catalyst, so that the problems due to the use of a catalyst cannot be solved.. The method of the above-mentioned (4) is limited to a method of obtaining an aromatic isocyanate compound without a catalyst from an aromatic carbamate compound.. The method of the above-mentioned (5) requires a catalyst at the time of obtaining a fluorine containing carbamate compound from a fluorine containing carbonic diester compound, so that the problems due to the use of a catalyst cannot be solved.. The method of the above-mentioned (6) also requires a catalyst, so that the problems due to the use of a catalyst cannot be solved.. The invention has been made in order to solve the above-mentioned problems, and it provides: a method of producing a carbamate compound that can provide an isocyanate compound with using neither phosgene nor a catalyst; a carbamate compound obtained by the method; and a method of producing an isocyanate compound using the carbamate compound..

As described above, the above-mentioned patent references 3 to 5 each disclose a method of obtaining an isocyanate compound without using a catalyst from a carbamate compound having a fluorine atom in its molecule. However, as is described in the patent references 4 and 5, it has been considered that a catalyst is necessary for producing such a carbamate compound having a fluorine atom in its molecule.. Specifically, paragraph [0081] of the patent reference 4 discloses an example in which an aromatic fluorine containing dicarbamate compound was produced by reacting 2,4-toluenediamine and bis(trifluoroethyl)carbonate at 140° C. for 20 hours using phosphagen as a catalyst, and paragraph [0082] thereof discloses a comparative example showing that the aromatic fluorine containing dicarbamate compound was not formed even by the same reaction carried out at 140° C. for 20 hours if phosphagen serving as the catalyst was not added.. In addition, Example 2.5. on page 30 of the publication of patent reference 5 discloses an example in which an aliphatic fluorine containing dicarbamate compound was produced by reacting 1,2-ethylenediamine with bis(trifluoroethyl)carbonate in the presence of a specified catalyst.. However, the present inventors have found a method by which a carbamate compound can be obtained, without using a catalyst, from a fluorine containing carbonic diester compound and a non aromatic diamine compound and also an isocyanate compound can be produced from the thus obtained carbamate compound without using a catalyst, thereby resulting in the accomplishment of the invention.. That is, the present invention provides a method of producing a carbamate compound, comprising reacting a fluorine containing carbonic diester compound represented by formula (1) and a non aromatic diamine compound represented by formula (2) without using a catalyst, to thereby produce a carbamate compound represented by formula (3)..

A of formula (20) is the A derived from the compound (2).. <p num=\"117\"><h2 id=\"h-0017\"><Production Method of Compound (1)></h2></p>. The compound (1) can be produced for example by the following method, in a high yield without using phosgene. In this connection, it is not limited to this method.. That is, the compound (1) is obtained by reacting a compound (21) with a fluorine containing aliphatic alcohol represented by R-OH(R is the same as the R of formula (1)), in the presence of a catalyst as necessary.. Each of X. to X. of formula (21) represents a hydrogen atom or a halogen atom, and at least one of the X. to X. is a halogen atom. Each of X. to X. represents a hydrogen atom or a halogen atom, and at least one of the X. to X. is a halogen atom.. It is preferable that each of the X. to X. is a halogen atom, more preferably fluorine atom or chlorine atom. Hexachloroacetone is most preferable as the compound (21) from the viewpoint that industrially useful chloroform can also be produced in a high yield as a by-product and in view of reactivity.. The catalyst includes an alkali metal, an alkaline earth metal; an alkali metal hydride, an alkaline earth metal hydride; an alkali metal hydroxide, an alkaline earth metal hydroxide; a phase-transfer catalyst; a halogen salt of an alkali metal, a halogen salt of an alkaline earth metal, a halogen salt of ammonium; an ion exchange resin; a compound of at least one metal selected from the group consisting of tin, titanium, aluminum, tungsten, molybdenum, zirconium and zinc; and at least one substance selected from the group consisting of ester exchange reaction catalysts.. From the viewpoints of easy handling, reaction activity and selectivity of the target substance in industrially using it, a halogen salt is preferable.

These catalyst and co-catalyst can be successfully separated and removed after the reaction by a conventional technique such as filtration, distillation or water washing, or a technique in combination thereof.. <p num=\"128\"><h2 id=\"h-0018\"><Production Method of Compound (3)></h2></p>. According to the invention, the compound (3) is obtained by reacting the compound (1) and compound (2) without using a catalyst. It is preferable to react from 2 moles to 20 moles, more preferably from 2 moles to 10 moles, of the compound (1) with 1 mole of the compound (2). The R-OH is by-produced by this reaction.. This reaction may be carried out under no solvent which does not use a solvent, or in a solvent. It is preferable to carry out the reaction under no solvent from the viewpoints that the compound (1) which is used in an excess amount acts by itself as a solvent, that there is a case of lowering the reaction activity due to dilution by use of the solvent, and that removal of the solvent is not necessary. In addition, the reaction may be carried out under normal pressure or under a pressurized condition (e.g., approximately from 0.11 MPa to 0.5 MPa).. Since the decomposition reaction is accelerated when the reaction temperature is too high and the material and formed product are solidified when it is too low, it is preferable to set the reaction temperature within such a range that these inconvenient phenomena do not occur. For example, it is preferably from -10° C. to 250° C., and more preferably from 0° C. to 150° C.. Since efficiency of the apparatus in the production process becomes poor when the reaction time is too long and there is a possibility that thermorunaway caused by an exothermic action becomes uncontrollable when the reaction is carried out within a short period of time, it is preferable to set the reaction time within such a range that these inconvenient phenomena do not occur. For example, a period of from 0.1 hour to 40 hours is preferable, and from 0.5 hour to 20 hours is more preferable. In this connection, the reaction time is not limited to this when kind of the reaction solvent and selectivity are seriously considered.. The by-produced R-OH (fluorine containing aliphatic alcohol) can be evaporated by heating or heating under a reduced pressure. The heating condition under a reduced pressure can be optionally set within such a range that it does not exert a bad influence upon the compound (3) as the target substance. For example, it is preferable to carry out the process under conditions of from 50° C. to 160° C. and from 135 Torr to 100 Torr (approximately from 18.0×10. Pa to 13.3×10. When a solvent is used, the solvent that satisfies the following condition (i) is preferable.. Condition (i): it does not substantially react with the compound (3).. The phrase  \n",
       "does not substantially react with compound (3) \n",
       " means that it does not react at all with the -N(H)-C(O)-O-R group of compound (3), or even when reacts therewith, it is such a slight level that it does not spoil the effect of the invention.. Examples of the group capable of reacting with the -N(H)-C(O)-O-R group of compound (3), include aldehyde group, acetoacetyl group, and an active hydrogen containing group. Accordingly, a solvent that does not have these groups is preferable as the solvent.. The aforementioned active hydrogen includes a hydrogen atom directly bonded to a hetero atom; a hydrogen atom bonded to the carbon atom adjacent to an electron attractive group (\u0003±-hydrogen atom); a hydrogen atom constituting a substitution aromatic substance; and a hydrogen atom constituting a functional group such as an aldehyde and a carboxylic acid.. The aforementioned hydrogen atom directly bonded to a hetero atom includes a hydrogen atom constituting a functional group such as -NH. group, -CONH group, -OH group, or -SH group.. The aforementioned hydrogen atom bonded to the carbon atom adjacent to an electron attractive group includes the \u0003±-position hydrogen atom of a carbonyl compound.. <p num=\"141\"><h2 id=\"h-0019\"><Production Method of Compound (20)></h2></p>. After obtaining the compound (3) by reacting the compound (1) and compound (2) in the absence of a catalyst, the excess materials and by-products are evaporated as necessary, and the compound (20) is produced from the compound (3) without using a catalyst. Illustratively, the compound (20) is obtained by subjecting the compound (3) to thermal decomposition. Since this reaction is a dealcoholization reaction and by-produces R-OH, it is preferable to carry out the reaction while evaporating the by-produced R-OH.. This reaction may be carried out under no solvent which does not use a solvent, or in a solvent. In addition, it may be carried out under normal pressure or may be carried out under a condition of a reduced pressure (e.g., approximately from 20 Torr to 6 Torr (about from 2,660 Pa to about 800 Pa)).. Since decomposition of the target products (isocyanate compounds) and formation of polymers occurs when the reaction temperature is too high and the reaction does not progress when it is too low, it is preferable to set the reaction temperature within such a range that these inconvenient phenomena do not occur. For example, it is preferably from 100° C. to 350° C., more preferably from 150° C. to 250° C.. Efficiency of the apparatus in the production process becomes poor when the reaction time is too long. For example, 100 hours or less is preferable and 40 hours or less is more preferable. In this connection, the reaction time is not limited to this when kind of the reaction solvent and selectivity are seriously considered and also varies depending on the reaction conditions. There is a case in which selectivity of the target substance can be improved when the reaction is carried out at a high temperature for a short period of time in order to inhibit decomposition of the product, using a continuous reaction process or the like.. When a solvent is used, the solvent that satisfies the following condition (ii) is preferable.. Condition (ii): it does not substantially react with isocyanate group of the compound (20), namely, it does not have the active hydrogen described in the above-mentioned condition (i). Use of a solvent which satisfies both of the conditions (i) and (ii) is preferable because the step of obtaining the compound (3) from the compound (1) and compound (2) and the step of obtaining the compound (20) from the compound (3) can be continuously carried out.. Examples of the solvent that satisfies both of the conditions (i) and (ii), preferably, includes illustratively at least one substance selected from the group consisting of ethers which do not have active hydrogen (such as diglyme, triglyme, diethyl ether or dibutyl ether), esters (such as ethyl acetate or butyl acetate), ketones (such as acetone, diethyl ketone or methyl isobutyl ketone), aliphatic hydrocarbons (such as hexane, heptane or octane), aromatic hydrocarbons (such as benzene, toluene, xylene, or ethylbenzene) and halogenated hydrocarbons (such as chloroform, carbon tetrachloride, dichloroethylene, or trichloroethylene).. In addition, the solvent may have two or more bonds, groups and/or atoms in 1 molecule, selected from the group consisting of an ether bond, an ester bond, a ketone, an aliphatic hydrocarbon group, an aromatic hydrocarbon group and a halogen atom. Such a solvent includes, for example, ester ethers (such as ethylene glycol monoethyl ether monoacetate).. According to the production method of the invention, the compound (3) can be produced from the compound (1) and compound (2) in a high yield without using a catalyst, and the compound (20) can be further produced from the compound (3) in a high yield without using a catalyst.. For example, yield of the compound (3) based on the compound (2) as a diamine compound can realize a level of 80% by mol or more. Yield of the compound (20) based on the compound (3) as a carbamate compound can realize a level of 50% by mol or more.. In addition, since a catalyst is not used at all, the formed product (compound (3) or compound (20)) can be easily isolated and the target substance can be easily obtained with a high purity.. As described above, it has been conventionally considered that a catalyst is necessary for the production of fluorine containing carbamate compounds, and actually, the patent reference 4 describes a case in which an aromatic fluorine containing dicarbamate compound was not formed when a catalyst was not used. In addition, as there is a description of  \n",
       "the amines which can be used in the context of the present invention are aliphatic or aromatic amines . . .  \n",
       " in paragraph [0030] of the patent reference 4, it has been considered that the reaction occurs in the same manner in the case of either an aliphatic amine or an aromatic amine.. However, to our surprise, according to the invention, when a non aromatic diamine compound which does not have an amino group directly bonded to an aromatic ring is used as a diamine compound to be reacted with a fluorine containing carbonic diester compound of the compound (1), a fluorine containing dicarbamate compound can be obtained through their reaction even in the absence of a catalyst. What is more, the thus obtained fluorine containing dicarbamate compound can be converted into a diisocyanate compound even in the absence of a catalyst.. Though the reason for this is not clear, it is considered that there is a great difference in reactivity between the amino group directly bonded to an aromatic ring and the amino group not bonded to the aromatic ring, upon reacting with the fluorine containing carbonic diester compound.. The following describes the invention further in detail using examples, though the invention is not limited to these examples. In the following, the conversion ratio is  \n",

The reaction was carried out under this condition for 5 hours while recovering the formed product by the recovery container arranged on the reflux line and a dry ice trap arranged between the reflux line and a decompression pump. The reaction products thus recovered in the recovery container was subjected to a gas chromatography analysis and it was confirmed that XDI is recovered as the main product. The intermediate XMI can be converted into XDI with a high yield by introducing it after its recovery again into the thermal decomposition reactor together with the material XDC-1. Therefore, this reaction enables to synthesis XDI in a high yield by the reaction of XDC-1.. A portion of XMI, which was concentrated by removing XDI and TFPO through evaporation of the crude liquid under a reduced pressure, was analyzed by mass spectrometry analysis. From the results, it was confirmed that it has the structure shown in formula C.. XML MS m/z: 51 (CF. H); 91 (PhCH. ); 118 (CHPhCHN); 146 (CHPhCHNC(=O)); 161 (CH. NPhCHNC(=O)): 188 (CH.
