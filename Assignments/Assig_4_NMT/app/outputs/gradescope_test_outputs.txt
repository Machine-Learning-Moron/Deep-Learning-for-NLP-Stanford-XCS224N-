So part of the <unk> practice is to recognize that under stress we're not going to be at the best time, and you have to put the systems in its site.
And there is perhaps no more stressful situation than when you're faced with a medical decision.
And at some point, we will all be in that situation, of having to make a very important decision about the future of our medical care or a loved one, to help them with a decision.
And so I want to talk about that.
And I'll talk about a very particular medical condition.
But this was <unk> as a <unk> for all of the medical decisions and in fact for decision-making financial decisions and social decisions, any kind of decision you need to take from which would benefit from the rational assessment of the facts.
So suppose you go to the doctor and the doctor says, "I've got the result of the lab and the cholesterol outcome is a little <unk>
You all know that high cholesterol is associated with a higher risk of heart disease, heart attack, <unk>
So you're thinking that you have high cholesterol cholesterol is not the best, then the doctor says, "I'd like to give you a drug to help reduce the <unk> a <unk>
And you probably have heard of the <unk> and you know that it's one of the most <unk> drugs in the world today. You even are likely to know people who are <unk>
So you think, "Yes, <unk> <unk>
But there's a question that you have to do then, a statistic that you should ask for which most doctors don't want to speak, and the pharmaceutical companies even less.
It's for <unk> the number you need to treat.
And what is this, <unk>
It's the number of people who have to take a drug or submit to surgery in any medical procedure before you can help a person.
And you must think of what kind of statistic that's <unk>
The number must be one.
My doctor didn't give me something if I wasn't going to help me.
But actually, medical practice doesn't work.
And it's not due to the doctor, and if it's <unk> it's from the scientists like me.
We haven't understood the <unk> mechanisms.
But the <unk> estimates that 90 percent of drugs works only about 30 to 50 percent of the people.
So the number you need to treat <unk> most widely <unk> what do you think it is?
How many people have to take it before to help someone else?
300.
This is by the research of cynical researchers <unk> <unk> and Pamela <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
I explored the numbers.
300 people have to take the drug for a year before they avoid a single heart attack, stroke brain or a <unk> event.
Now you might think, "Well, one chance in 300 of my <unk>
Why not <unk> <unk> the recipe for everybody <unk>
But then you have to ask for one more statistic and it is, <unk> of the effects of <unk> Yes?
For this particular drug, the side effects are produced by five percent of patients.
And those include things -- <unk> <unk> <unk> muscle pain and <unk> <unk> <unk> but now they think, <unk> is not very likely that I happen to me, still <unk>
But a moment.
And remember that under stress you don't think quite clearly.
So think about how to <unk> that over time, so you don't have to make the chain of reasoning on the act.
300 people take the drug, right? A person has <unk> five percent of the 300 they have side effects, that's 15 people.
You have 15 times more likely to get <unk> by the drug that helps you to help you.
I don't say they had to take the <unk>
I just say they must have this conversation with your doctor.
<unk> ethics <unk> is part of the first informed consent principle.
We have a right to have access to this kind of information to start the conversation about whether you want to take the risks or not.
Maybe you're thinking that I've launched this number in the air of the crash, but actually this number you need to treat is quite typical.
For the surgery that more is done in the biggest men of 50, prostate cancer, the number you need to deal with is <unk>
This is 49 surgeries by a person who has <unk>
And the side effects in that case, they produce in 50 percent of patients.
Those include <unk> or dysfunction -- <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
And if you're lucky and it's one of that 50 percent of the effects only <unk> a year or two.
So the idea of <unk> is to think before the questions that you can argue that we would take the conversation forward.
You don't have what to make all this stuff on the act.
And they also want to think about the quality of life.
Because it's got a choice a lot of times, they want a shorter life <unk> or a longer life that might have much pain to the end?
These are the things that they speak and think about them with their family and their loved ones.
You can change in the heat of the moment, but unless you're trained in this kind of thought.
Remember, our brain releases <unk> under stress, and one of the things that happens at that moment is that a lot of systems.
There's an evolutionary reason for this.
Face 2 Face with one predator, you don't need the <unk> system, or the <unk> or the immune system, because if your body is spending metabolism on those things, it doesn't react very quickly. You might get to be the lunch of the lions, so none of that matters.
Unfortunately, one of the things that goes through the window during those moments of stress is the rational sense of rational as Danny <unk> and his colleagues have shown.
So we have to <unk> to think about the future to these kinds of situations.
I think the important thing here is to recognize that we're all <unk>
We're all going to fail once in time.
The idea is to think about the future how those <unk> might be able to put the systems in the place that will help us minimize damage, or to prevent the bad things in the first place.
<unk> on the night of snow in <unk> when I returned from my journey, my contractor installed a combination of combination with the door, with a key to the gate of entry in the same way, an easy way of it.
And I have to admit that I still have lots of letters that I haven't ordered and lots of text messages that I haven't seen.
So I'm not very organized, but I see the organization like a <unk> process, and I'm doing it.
Thank you very much.
Interpreter: <unk> <unk> is my favorite <unk>
It means <unk> <unk>
If you're playing a musical instrument and you see a <unk> in the <unk> you need to touch <unk>
Two <unk> even more gentle.
Four <unk> extremely smooth.
This is my drawing of a <unk> tree, there you see it no matter how many thousands of <unk> and thousands of <unk> may be never <unk> to a complete silence.
That's my current definition of <unk> a very dark sound.
I'd like to share a little bit about the history of the American American system, the <unk> besides a little bit of my own story.
The French signs came over over the decade, and over the time, it mixed with local signs, and he developed the language that we now know as a <unk>
So it has a story of about 200 years.
I was born <unk> and I was taught to believe that sound wasn't a part of my life.
And I thought it was true.
But now I realize that it's not true at all.
<unk> are a very important part of my life, actually in my mind every day.
As a <unk> person, who lives in a sound world, it's like I lived in a foreign country, following blindly their rules, <unk> behaviors and norms without <unk>
So how do I understand the <unk>
Well, I see how people behave and respond to sound.
People are like my speakers and <unk> the sound.
<unk> and <unk> that behavior.
At the same time, I've learned that I can create sound, and I've seen how people <unk>
So I've learned for example ...
"Don't <unk> <unk>
"Don't do a lot of noise to eat the bag of potato <unk>
"Not <unk> and when you're eating, make you not <unk> the <unk>
I call this <unk> <unk>
Maybe I think about the sound label than the average person does it.
I'm super <unk> of sound.
And I'm always waiting with <unk> the sound, which is going to come next.
From there, this drawing.
<unk> <unk>
<unk> to go on.
<unk> for <unk>
You can see the <unk> doesn't have notes in the lines.
That's because the lines already contain sounds through the <unk> subtle and <unk>
In <unk> culture, the movement is equivalent to sound.
This is the signal for <unk> in <unk>
A typical <unk> has five lines.
However, to me, do it with my thumb that doesn't feel natural.
That's why I just have four lines on the paper.
In 2008, 2008, I had the opportunity to travel to Berlin, Germany, for an artistic <unk> there.
Before this time, he had worked like <unk>
For this summer, I visited museums and spaces of different <unk> and as I went from one place to another, I realized that there was no visual art there.
At that time, the sound was the trend and that called me the <unk>
There was no visual art, everything was <unk>
Now sound has come into my territory of art.
Will I get more of the art?
I realized that it doesn't have to be like this.
In fact, I know the sound.
I know that well that not only experience through the ears.
I can feel it <unk> or experience it visually, or even as an idea.
So I decided to reclaim the sound and <unk> in my artistic practice.
And everything I had taught me in sound, I decided to drop it and <unk>
I began to create a new body of work.
And when I presented it to the art community, I was struck with the amount of support and attention that I had.
I realized that sound is like money, power, <unk> social currency.
In the background of my mind, I always felt that the sound was <unk> it was something of a <unk> person.
And the sound is so powerful that well I could go to me and my artistic work, or I could tell me.
I chose to be <unk>
There's a massive culture around the verbal language.
And only because I don't use my literal voice to communicate, the eyes of society is as if I had no voice at all.
So I have to work with people who can support me equally and become my voice.
So I am able to be relevant in today's society.
So in school, at work and institutions, work with many different performers of <unk>
And his voice becomes my voice and identity.
They help me be <unk>
And their voices have value and weight.
Ironically, when you're asking for <unk> their voices, I'm able to maintain a temporary form of value as well as taking a loan out of a very high interest rate.
If I'm not going to stay with this practice, I feel that I could be <unk> in the <unk> and not have any kind of social value.
So with sound like my new artistic medium <unk> in the world of music.
And I was surprised by seeing the similarities between music and <unk>
For example, a musical note cannot be capture and expressing in the paper.
And the same thing can be said about a concept in <unk>
The two are very <unk> and highly <unk> which means that subtle changes can affect the whole meaning as much of the signals like the sounds.
I'd like to share with you a metaphor for the piano, so that you understand how the <unk> works.
So, imagine a piano.
The <unk> split up in many different parameters.
If you put a <unk> different <unk> for each finger as you get the piano, like your facial expression, the body, the speed, the shape of your hand, and so while the piano, the English is a linear language, as if it comes to the piano at the time.
However, the <unk> is more like a chord, you need the 10 fingers in <unk> to express a very clear concept or <unk>
If only a key to change the chord, it would create a completely different meaning.
The same thing happens with music in terms of tone and <unk> and volume.
In <unk> by using these different parameters <unk> you can express different ideas.
For example, the <unk> sign in that."
This is the <unk> sign in that."
I'm looking at.
<unk> <unk>
Oh, I <unk>
<unk> oh.
What are you <unk>
Ah, <unk>
So I started thinking, and if I see <unk> through the lenses in music?
If I had to create a sign and it <unk> it again and again, it could be like a piece of visual music.
For example, this is the sign of <unk> the sun comes out and you're wearing it.
This is all the day."
If you <unk> it and <unk> the visually speed, you see it as a piece of music.
The whole day.
I feel that the same thing can be said to <unk> the <unk>
"All the <unk>
This is all night.
And this led me to think about three different types of <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>  <unk> <unk>
I feel that the third one has more <unk> than the other two.
This is what the time is expressed in <unk> and how the distance the body can express changes in time.
For example, one <unk> is a hand, two <unk> is two hands, the present gets closer and in front of the body, the future is in front of the body, and the past is on the back.
So the first example is to spend a lot of time."
Then, <unk> <unk> <unk> and the last one, which is my favorite, with a very romantic idea, and dramatic at the time, <unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk> is a musical term with a <unk> rate per <unk>
However, when I see the word <unk> <unk> I think automatically in <unk> very time."
Watch <unk> <unk> right hand. <unk> left hand.
We have the <unk> through my head and my chest.
<unk>
You can do it with me?
All of my hands in high.
Now we're going to do it both on your head as well as <unk> <unk> or <unk>
Yeah, good.
That means <unk> in the international system.
The international system, as a note, is a visual tool to help communicate in all cultures and language languages around the world.
The second one that I'd like to show you is this. Please do it with me again.
And now this.
It means <unk> in <unk>
Now, the third. Please go back again.
And again.
It's <unk> in <unk>
We're going to do three together.
<unk> <unk> and <unk>
Good job.
Look at how the three signs are very similar. They all happen in your head and your chest but they get very different.
It's amazing to see how the <unk> is alive and wealthy as the music.
Yet today, we live in a very <unk> world.
And only because the <unk> doesn't have sound, it automatically doesn't have social value.
We have to start questioning what defines social value and allowing the <unk> to develop its own value, no sounds.
And this could be a step to make a more <unk> society.
And maybe people understand that you don't have to be deaf, to learn <unk> and you have to hear to learn music.
<unk> is a rich trove and I'd like you to have the same experience.
I'd like to <unk> your ears, open your eyes, to participate in our culture and experience of our visual language.
And you never know, you can even fall in love with us.
Thank you.
<unk> <unk> Hey, that's me.
As a child, my parents said, "You can tell you everything, but then you have to <unk>
<unk> implies responsibility.
But my imagination took me to all these wonderful places, where everything was possible.
So I grew up in a bubble of innocence or a bubble of ignorance I have to say, because adults would lie to us to protect us from the awful truth.
By getting older, I learned that adults also <unk> and they are not really good to clean up the others.
The time country, now I'm an adult and I teach citizen and invention in <unk> school in Hong Kong.
You don't have to wait much for my students to walk around the beach with piles of trash.
So as good citizens, we cleaned up the <unk> and no, it's not drinking alcohol, and if it is, I don't know it.
It's sad to say, but more than 80 percent of the oceans contain plastic.
It's a bit creepy.
And in the last few decades, we've been coming out with these large ships and networks, and we collect those pieces of plastic to study them under the microscope, and the <unk> and <unk> this information on a map.
But lasts for an eternity and it's very expensive and it's also very risky and it's also very risky to use.
So together with my students, two to 15 years, we dream to invent a better way.
We've transformed our tiny classroom in Hong Kong in a workshop.
We started building this <unk> work <unk> so that kids are very <unk> they can also participate.
And I'm going to tell you, children who manipulate electrical tools are very cool, safe.
Not exactly.
Let's go back to plastic.
We collect plastic and reduce it to the size we find it in the ocean, which is very small, because of its <unk>
That's what we do.
I leave it to the imagination of my students.
My job is to try to take the best ideas of every child and try to <unk> into something that we hope to work.
We decided instead of collecting pieces of plastic, just <unk> information.
Through the use of a robot, we took a picture of this <unk> the kids would have a lot of robots.
And then we created quickly what we call "a <unk>
We are so quick in creating prototypes that we ended up before lunch.
And we turned out the <unk> and web cameras on accessories and <unk> it into a floating robot that will move slowly through the water and the plastic that we have there, and this is the image captured by the robot.
We see the bits of plastic floating slowly through the sensor while the computer on board processing this image and measuring the size of every <unk> to get an estimate of the amount of plastic in the water.
<unk> this <unk> invention on a website for inventors called <unk> with the hope that someone else gets it even more.
The great thing about this project is that students saw a local problem, and they are trying to be trying to fix it.
I'm able to investigate my <unk> problem. But my students in Hong Kong are very much kids.
You see the news, <unk> the Internet, and you see it with this image.
A child, maybe less than 10 years, cleaning an oil spill, just using the hands in <unk> the largest <unk> forest in the world in Bangladesh.
They were really surprised because this is the water that <unk> is the water where the water is <unk> the water where we live.
You can also see that the water is brown, the mud and the oil are also brown color and when everything is <unk> it's very difficult to see what there is in the water.
But there's a simple technology called <unk> which allows you to see what's in the water.
We built a very first prototype of a <unk> that can <unk> through all sorts of things that produce <unk> what can help to identify what is in the water.
We took this prototype with a sensor and put it to Bangladesh.
The great thing about this project is that beyond solving a local problem, or to analyze a local problem, my students used their empathy and their sense of creativity to help <unk> other children.
I was forced to do a problem with <unk> and I was forced to do a second experiment, and I wanted to go a little further, maybe to address a harder problem, and also closer to me.
I'm half Japanese and French and maybe remember, in 2011, there was a devastating earthquake in Japan.
It was so violent that triggered various giant waves called <unk> and those <unk> <unk> across the coast of Japan.
More than 14,000 people died in a second.
It also gives the nuclear power plant of Fukushima, a nuclear power <unk>
And today, according to the reports on a 300 of 300 tons are still leaking out of the nuclear plant in the Pacific.
Today, the Pacific Ocean has traces of pollution on <unk>
If we go to the West coast, we can measure the radiation of <unk> everywhere.
But if you look at the map, it seems that most of the radiation disappeared from the Japanese coast, and most of them -- very often, is blue.
Well, reality is a little bit more complicated than that.
I've gone back to <unk> every year since the crash and independently independent with other scientists, the land, the river, and this time we wanted to bring the kids.
Of course not <unk> the parents don't know.
But every night we go to the center of <unk> here you see the use of different <unk>
It might seem like they didn't take the serious job seriously, but they did it because they're going to have to live with the <unk> their whole life.
Together with them we discussed the data <unk> that day, and we talked about what we were going to do next, the <unk> the <unk> and so on.
And to do this, we created a <unk> map of the region around the nuclear power plant.
We created the map of <unk> <unk> pigment to represent real-time data from <unk> and <unk> water to simulate the rain.
We were able to notice that the radioactive powder was <unk> from the top of the mountain to the <unk> and <unk> system in the ocean.
It was an <unk> <unk>
But based on this we organized a civil <unk> the closest to the nuclear power to date.
We're approaching us to a half miles of the nuclear plant, and with the help of fishermen from the zone we were collecting <unk> sediments with a <unk> tracking device as we invented and build.
Here we see a <unk> we've gone from a local problem to a remote problem to a global problem.
And it's been very exciting to work on these different scales, also with open-source technologies and very simple.
But at the same time, it's been increasingly frustrating because we've only been starting to measure the damage that we've done.
We haven't even begun to try to solve the problems.
I wonder if we should take the leap and try to invent better ways of doing all these things.
So the classroom became a little bit so small so we found an industrial installation in Hong Kong and we become the greatest space dedicated to the social impact and environmental impact.
It's in the center of Hong Kong -- and it's a place where we can work with <unk> metal, chemistry a little bit of biology, of course, you can build almost everything there.
It's also a place where adults and kids can play together.
It's a place where dreams of children can actually become true with adults, and where adults can be children again.
<unk> <unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk> We asked things like, we can invent the future of mobility with <unk> energy.
So for example.
Or we can help in the mobility of the advanced population transforming their standard wheelchair into new vehicles in new vehicles.
And the plastic, oil and <unk> are <unk> terrible, but the worst legacy we can leave our children are lies.
We cannot afford to protect the children of the horrible truth because we need their imagination to invent the solutions.
So as scientists, creators <unk> we need to prepare the next generation to get care of the environment and people, and so that I can actually do something about it.
Thank you.
Two <unk> <unk> two different design cultures completely <unk>
One is made of thousands of pieces of steel, the other one of a single silk thread of <unk>
One of them is synthetic -- the other organic <unk>
One <unk> on the environment, the other thing believed it.
One is designed by nature, the other for it.
Michelangelo said that when he looked at the <unk> <unk> he saw a figure that fights for being free.
The <unk> was only a tool of Michelangelo.
But living beings are not <unk>
They grow.
And in the smallest units of life, the cells, we took all of the information for each cell to work and to make it happen.
The tools also have consequences.
At least since the Industrial Revolution, the world of design has been dominated by <unk> and manufacturing and mass production.
The assembly lines have dictated a world made out of parts, <unk> the imagination of designers and architects trained to think of their objects as <unk> parts of different functions.
But you don't find <unk> material in nature.
Think of the human skin, for example.
Our facial skins are thin with light-activated pore.
The skins of the back are more thick with small <unk>
You act mostly like filter the other mostly as barrier, and yet, it's the same <unk> there's no parts, no <unk>
It's a system that varies gradually its functionality through <unk>
Here's a broken screen, which represents my vision of the world -- the <unk> personality of every designer and an architect, to work between the <unk> and the gene, between the assembly and the <unk> between the assembly and the growth between the assembly and the growth, between Henry Ford and Charles Darwin.
These two visions of the world, my left hemisphere and the law, analysis and synthesis, it shows on the two screens after me.
My work, on the simplest level, it tries to bring these two visions of the world, moving from assembly and coming up to growth.
You probably ask yourself, Why now?
Why wasn't it possible to do 10 or even five years?
We live in a very special moment in history, a rare moment, where they have four disciplines that offer designers access to tools that we had never had access to before.
And at the intersection of these four fields, my team and I thought.
Please know the minds and the hands of my students.
We design objects, products, structures and tools and tools through scale, large-scale <unk> like this robotic arm with a <unk> diameter <unk> with a force that will someday not very far distant to print <unk> buildings, and the nanoscale made of genetically engineered <unk> that glow in the dark.
Here we have <unk> the <unk> an archetype of ancient Arab architecture, and it has created a screen where every aperture is unique to shape the form of light and heat through it.
In our next project, we explore the possibility of creating a layer and a <unk> -- this was for a <unk> fashion <unk> with <unk> -- it's like a second skin made from one piece, <unk> in the flexible <unk> around the waist.
Together with 3D printing collaborator, <unk> we printed this layer and 3D <unk> between the cells -- I'll show you more objects like that.
This helmet combines rigid and <unk> materials in the resolution of 20 <unk>
This is the resolution of a human hair.
It's also the resolution of a <unk> scanner.
That designers have access to this high-resolution <unk> and the <unk> instruments allow to design products that are <unk> not only the shape of our bodies, but also the physiological structure of our tissues.
We also designed a acoustic chair, a chair at the same and comfortable chair and also absorb sound.
The Carter professor, my collaborator went back to the nature of <unk> and by designing this <unk> pattern becomes <unk>
<unk> this surface of 44 different properties, which vary in <unk> <unk> and color, <unk> to the points of pressure in the human body.
Its surface, as in nature, stick its functionality not through the addition of other material or another <unk> but <unk> continuously and <unk> the material itself.
But it's the <unk> nature.
There is no parts in nature?
I didn't grew up in a religious Jewish home, but when I was young, my grandmother told me stories of the Bible <unk> and one of them was stuck and really define what it matters.
Like she <unk> "In the third day of <unk> God sends the Earth to grow a <unk> tree <unk>
For that first tree <unk> there would be no difference between trunk, branches and <unk>
The whole tree was a piece of fruit.
Instead, the land made up trees and cortex, <unk> and flowers.
The land created a world made of place.
I often ask myself, "What would the design look like if objects came to do <unk>
<unk> a better state of the <unk>
So we looked for the material to <unk> the kind of material material <unk> with fruits, and we found it.
The second <unk> most abundant on the planet is called <unk> and about 100 million tons per year like shrimp, or <unk> <unk> and <unk>
We thought that if we could tune their properties, we could generate <unk> structures in one piece.
So that's what we did.
We call it <unk> legal <unk>  <unk> a lot of <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk>
<unk> chemical concentrations have been able to achieve a wide range of properties, from dark, hard and <unk> to the light, smooth and transparent.
To print the large-scale structures that was built up a system with multiple <unk> <unk> <unk>
The robot could vary the properties of the material about the march and create these structures made of one material three or long, 100 percent recycled.
When the pieces are ready, it leaves it dry in order to find a natural way to contact with the air.
So why do we keep designing with <unk>
The air bubbles that were a byproduct of the printing process was used to contain <unk> <unk> which appeared for the first time on the planet three billion years ago, as we heard yesterday.
Together with our collaborators at Harvard and MIT, <unk> the genetically engineered bacteria to capture very rapidly carbon from the atmosphere and turn it into sugar.
For the first time, we have been able to generate structures that make their transition without <unk> <unk> and if it grew up even further, the window.
A <unk> tree.
Working with an old material, one of the first forms of life on the planet, with abundant water and a little bit of synthetic biology, we've transformed a structure made of seed <unk> in a architecture that behaves like a tree.
And here's the best two: for objects designed for <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> life and placed on the floor, will help grow a tree.
The <unk> for our next principles of design was the solar system.
We are looking for the possibility of creating clothes to keep life for <unk>
To do that, we must master bacteria and control their flow.
So as the <unk> <unk> we made our own <unk> <unk> new forms of life created <unk> made in <unk> and <unk> <unk>
I like to think of synthetic biology such as the liquid <unk> only that instead of <unk> metals that are <unk> new subjective <unk> of very small channels in very small channels.
This field is called <unk>
We <unk> our own 3D channels to control the flow of these <unk> <unk>
In our first piece of clothes, <unk> two <unk>
The first is <unk>
It lives in our oceans and in the <unk> <unk>
And the second E. <unk> the bacteria that <unk> in the human intestine.
It turns out the light in sugar, the other consumes sugar and produces useful biofuels to the built environment.
But these two <unk> don't interact in nature.
In fact, they never <unk>
They're here, designed for the first time, to have a relationship in a piece of clothes.
Think of it as evolution, not by natural selection, but evolution design.
In order to contain these relationships, we've created a single channel that relates to the digestive tract that will help you <unk> these bacteria and make their function of path.
So we started to grow those channels in the human body, <unk> the properties of material according to <unk> functionality as well.
If we wanted more <unk> <unk> channels more transparent.
This <unk> <unk> system when it reaches from one end to another, <unk> meters.
This is half the length of a football field and 10 times more than our gut <unk>
And here it is, like <unk> at TED, our first <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
Thank you.
Mary <unk> said, "We are early <unk> only half is <unk>
What if design would provide the other <unk>
And if we could create structures that increase <unk>
And if we could create personal <unk> that <unk> our skin -- <unk> the mental tissue, and <unk> our <unk>
Think of this as a way of edit biology.
I call this material ecology.
To do that, you always have to go back to nature.
So you know that a 3D printer actually prints material into layers.
You also know that nature doesn't do that.
<unk> <unk> <unk>
This <unk> of the <unk> for example, creates a highly sophisticated architecture, a home in which they were <unk>
<unk> manufacturing is about this level of <unk>
It does it through the combination of two materials, but two proteins in different <unk>
One acts as a structure, the other is the glue or the matrix, uniting those fibers in each other.
And this is happening across scales.
The silk worm first turned into the environment, creates a <unk> structure, and then it starts to <unk> a cocoon of compression.
The tension and <unk> the two forces of life, they manifest themselves in a single material.
In order to understand better how this complex process works, we attach a small magnet to the head of a silk worm to <unk>
We put it inside a box with magnetic sensors, and that allowed us to create this cloud of points in three dimensions and visualizing the complex architecture of the cocoon of <unk> <unk>
Yet when we put the silk worm into a flat patch -- not within a box, we realized that they <unk> a <unk> flat and still <unk> <unk>
So we started designing different parts -- different <unk> and we've discovered that the shape, the composition, the structure of the <unk> is transmitted directly by the environment.
They often <unk> silk worms to death within their <unk> their silk <unk> and used in the <unk> industry.
We saw that designing these templates can shape <unk> silk and <unk> just <unk>
It was <unk> <unk> and we could create these things.
So we climb this process up to the architectural scale.
We had a robot <unk> doing <unk> <unk> and we put ourselves on our site.
We knew that silk worms are <unk> into the darkest and dark areas that are using a solar route diagram to reveal the distribution of light and heat in our structure.
So we created holes or <unk> to block the rays out of light and heat -- distributed silk worms on the structure.
We were prepared to get <unk>
We wanted to <unk> <unk> silk <unk>
And after <unk> four weeks, they were prepared to <unk> with us.
We put them carefully on the bottom of the <unk> and while <unk> <unk> got <unk> and <unk> <unk> and life begins again, like us, but much, much more short.
Buckminster Fuller said that tension is the great integrity, and he was right.
By <unk> biological silk on <unk> <unk> <unk> you give all this pavilion its integrity.
And in a little bit of two or three weeks, we <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> mile.
In a curious symmetry, this is also the length of the road <unk>
The <unk> after the <unk> produce 1.5 million eggs.
This could be used for 250 additional <unk> in the future.
So here are the two visions of the world.
A <unk> silk is using a robotic arm, the <unk> <unk>
If the last frontier of design is to give products to the products and the buildings around us, to form a material ecology of two materials, designers must bring these two visions of the world.
Which brings us back, of course, at the beginning.
Here's a new era of design, a new era of creation, which leads us to a biologically inspired design in nature to a nature inspired by design, which demands us, for the first time that we take charge of nature.
Thank you.
Thank you very much. Thank you.
Raise your hand if you ever wondered what you want to be from <unk>
If you had to remember how old they were when they asked them for the first time.
You can stick with your fingers.
Three. Five. Three. Five. Five. Five.
Now, raise your hand if the question is, "What do you want to be <unk>
It has caused some kind of anxiety of anxiety.
Any anxiety.
I'm somebody who could never answer the question, "What do you want to be <unk>
The problem wasn't that I didn't have any interest, but I had <unk>
In school I liked the English <unk> and art and art and creating websites, he was playing the guitar into a punk band, called <unk> <unk>
Maybe you've heard about us.
And in general, I like to test and persist in every rate, because I have spent a lot of time and energy and sometimes money in this field.
But in the time this sense of <unk> this sense of, this is no longer a challenge.
And I have to give it up.
But then I came up with something else, something completely different, and I would get rid of it, and I let myself absorb and I feel <unk> I've found I <unk> and then again this point where I start to <unk>
And eventually, I want to give it up.
But then I would like to discover something new and different, and I'd like to go into that.
This pattern caused me so much to anxiety, for two reasons.
The first one was because I wasn't sure how I was going to turn this whole thing into a career.
I thought I had to choose one thing, to deny all my other passions, and I was <unk> to <unk>
Another reason that made me so much anxiety was a little bit more personal.
I was worried that there was something wrong with this, and something bad in me for nothing.
I was worried to be afraid of commitment, or being dispersed, or <unk> or my own success.
If you can relate to my story and these feelings, I'd like to ask you something that I'd like to have been given me to have been on.
<unk> themselves, where they learned to allocate the meaning of evil or abnormal to do things.
I'm going to tell you where the <unk> learned of culture.
Can you tell us what you want to be from <unk>
When we have about five years.
And the truth is that nobody cares about what you were at that age.
It's considered a naive issue to make nice answers in kids like, <unk> <unk> or <unk> <unk> or I want to be <unk>
<unk> the <unk> <unk> here.
So this question gets us over and over again as we grow different ways, <unk> <unk> to high school students are asked to pick up in college.
And at some point, "What do you want to be <unk>
It happens to be the nice exercise of before it takes away the dream.
Why?
If this issue is inspired by children to dream of what might be, not inspired to dream about everything that might be.
In fact, it does exactly the opposite.
You have to <unk>
This is Dr. Bob <unk>  and he's a <unk> <unk> and <unk>
And this <unk> editor of magazine turned on <unk> <unk> teacher and <unk>
But most kids don't hear about people like this.
Everything you hear is they're going to have to choose.
But it's more than that.
The whole life notion is very <unk> in our culture.
It's this idea of fate or the real <unk> the idea that each one of us has something to do during your time on this land, and you have to figure out what that thing is and dedicate your life to it.
But what if you're somebody who is not connected in this way?
What if there are many different issues that wake up their curiosity and lots of different things you want to do?
There's no place for someone like one in that frame.
And so you can feel itself.
You can feel that it doesn't have a goal.
And I feel like there's something wrong with one.
There's nothing wrong with you.
You're a <unk>
A <unk> is someone with many interests and creative activities.
It's a <unk> so say.
Could it help if you divide in three <unk> multiple potential and <unk>
You can also use other terms that we <unk> the same idea, like <unk> <unk>
During the <unk> era, the ideal was that I was okay in multiple disciplines.
Barbara <unk> refers to us as <unk>
It <unk> any term you like or <unk> your own.
It seems to me as a species to adapt to a community, we can't agree with a single identity.
It's easy to see <unk> as limitation or <unk> that you must win.
But what I've learned by talking to people and writing about these ideas on my website, is that there's huge strengths to be in this way.
Here's three superpowers <unk>
One: the synthesis of ideas.
I mean, the combination of two or more fields and creation of something new in the <unk>
<unk> <unk> and Rachel <unk> <unk> their shared interests on cartography, data visualization, of data, travel, math and design, by <unk>
<unk> is a company that creates jewelry <unk>
And <unk> and Rachel came up with this whole idea of its unique <unk> of skills and experiences.
Innovation is happening at intersections.
There comes new ideas.
And the <unk> with all their background can get to a large number of these points of <unk>
The second <unk> <unk> is learning fast.
When we <unk> we are interested in something, we go to it.
We look at everything we can have in our hands.
We're used to being <unk> by having been a lot of times in the past, and this means that we have less fear of testing new things and out of our comfort.
Many skills are <unk> to other disciplines, and we bring everything we've learned to each new zone that we have, so we rarely start from zero.
<unk> <unk> is a <unk> full-time <unk> and <unk>
As a girl pianist <unk> an incredible capacity to develop muscle memory.
Now, she's the fastest <unk>
Before he turned into a writer, <unk> was a financial <unk>
He had to learn the <unk> mechanics when I was starting their thumb, and this ability helps to write a compelling <unk> for the editors
It rarely is a waste of time to go to what you would tell you, even if you end up <unk>
It's possible to apply that knowledge in a completely different field, in a way that you could not have <unk>
The third superpower, <unk> is adaptability. That is to say, the ability to turn into whatever you need in a <unk> situation.
<unk> <unk> is sometimes director of videos, other websites, sometimes consultant as a Kickstarter, sometimes a teacher, and sometimes, apparently, James <unk>
It's valuable because it does a good job.
He's even more valuable because it can take different <unk> depending on the needs of your clients.
<unk> magazine, Company defines adaptability as the most important ability for development, to flourish in the 21st century.
The economic world changes so rapidly and <unk> that are the individuals and organizations that can <unk> to meet the market needs that really <unk>
<unk> of ideas, quickly learning and <unk> three abilities where <unk> are very <unk> and three skills that you could lose if you're an <unk> to reduce your targets.
As a society, we have a great interest in foster the <unk> that they are themselves.
We have complex problems -- <unk> right now, and we need creative thinkers to deal with them.
Let's say they are, in your heart, <unk>
<unk> of the <unk> knowing that they wanted to be <unk> <unk>
Don't worry, there's nothing wrong with you, either.
In fact, some of the best teams get from a specialist and a <unk> <unk>
The expert can dive deep deep and put in practice, ideas, and <unk> offers a <unk> of knowledge to the project.
It's a beautiful relationship.
But we should all design lives and careers that are going to match how we are connected.
And unfortunately, the <unk> in many of them will remind them to just be more like their fellow <unk>
Once he said this, if there's one thing that you can take from this talk, I hope that it is this: <unk> with <unk> whatever it is.
If you are a heart attack, then you walk through all the media.
That's where you will give the best of it.
But for the <unk> in the room, including those who just realized being one of them in the last 12 minutes,  I say, <unk> with your many passions.
Keep his curiosity through those <unk> <unk>
<unk> intersections.
<unk> our internal wiring leads us to a more authentic and happy life.
And perhaps most importantly, <unk> the world <unk>
Thank you.
In <unk> a woman called <unk> they brought her to a psychiatric <unk>
<unk> <unk> and couldn't remember even the most basic details of his life.
His doctor was called <unk>
<unk> I didn't know how to help <unk> but <unk> for her until unfortunately, passed away in <unk>
After his death, <unk> did a <unk> and found strange <unk> and <unk> in the <unk> brain of a guy that had never seen before.
The most amazing thing is yet.
If you have been living today, I would have been living today, and we could not give her more help than <unk> gave him a <unk> years ago.
<unk> was Dr. <unk> Alzheimer's disease.
And <unk> <unk> the first patient to get a diagnosis that we now call Alzheimer's disease.
From <unk> medicine has been very advanced done.
They have discovered antibiotics and vaccines to protect us from the <unk> many treatments for <unk> <unk> for HIV, <unk> for <unk> and much more.
But it's been made in the treatment of Alzheimer's disease.
I'm a part of a team of scientists who work to find a cure for Alzheimer's of a decade.
So I think about this all the time.
Alzheimer's now is now affecting 40 million across the world.
But by 2050, it will affect 150 million that, by the way, to include many of you.
If you wait to live up to 85 years or more, the chance of Alzheimer's will be almost one of two two.
In other words, there is the likelihood that you spend your <unk> years or help care of a friend or help care of a friend or be wanted Alzheimer's disease.
Already in the United States, Alzheimer's <unk> costs 200 billion every year.
One of the five dollars of healthcare is spends in Alzheimer's disease.
Today it's the most expensive disease and their costs of <unk> <unk> increase in year by 2050, as the generation of the <unk> <unk>
Now, that may surprise you, but Alzheimer's is one of the biggest social challenges and social challenges of our generation.
But it's done relatively little to <unk>
Today, one of the top 10 causes of death around the world, Alzheimer's is the only one that cannot be <unk> to cure or even slow its development.
We understand less than Alzheimer's disease than other diseases, because we've invested less time and money in the research itself.
The U.S. government spends 10 times more every year in cancer research than Alzheimer's disease despite the fact that it costs us more Alzheimer's and causes an annual number of deaths like cancer.
The lack of resources is due to a more fundamental cause, the lack of consciousness.
Because this is what little people know, but the whole world is <unk> Alzheimer's is a disease, and we can <unk>
For most of the last <unk> years, all the scientists, <unk> Alzheimer's for aging.
We think it's going to be <unk> in a normal and inevitable part of aging.
But there's only one of you to look at a picture of a healthy brain compared with a Alzheimer's disease to see the real physical damage caused by this disease.
In addition to trigger a severe loss of memory and mental skills, the damage to the brain caused by Alzheimer's significantly life expectancy and is always deadly.
Remember, Dr. Alzheimer's found plates and <unk> strangers in the brain of <unk> a century ago.
For almost a century, we didn't know a lot about this.
We now know that they're made of protein molecules.
You can think of a protein molecule like a piece of paper that folds into an origami.
There are places in the paper that are <unk>
And when it folds out, these <unk> dots end up inside.
But sometimes things go wrong, and some dots are missing in the outside.
This makes the protein molecules <unk> each other, forming groups that can form big plates and <unk>
That's what we see in the brain of patients with Alzheimer's disease.
We've spent the last 10 years at Cambridge University trying to understand how this <unk> works.
There are many steps, and the identification of what step block is complex, as <unk> a bomb.
<unk> a cable could do nothing.
<unk> others can make the bomb bomb.
You have to find the right step to do it, and then create a drug that is doing it.
Until recently, most of the wires have been lowered and expected the best.
But now there's a diverse group of people, doctors, biologists, <unk> chemicals, physicists, engineers, mathematicians.
And together, we've managed to identify a critical step in the process. Now you're testing a new kind of drugs that block specifically this step to stop the disease.
I'll show you some of our last outcomes.
No one outside of our lab has seen it yet.
Let's look at some videos of what happened when we test these drugs in <unk>
These are the healthy worms -- and you can see that they move normally.
These maggots, the maggots, on the other hand, have molecules of protein that stick in each other inside them, as in humans with Alzheimer's disease.
And you can see that they're clearly <unk>
But by giving our new drugs to these worms at a early stage, then we see that <unk> and live a normal life.
This is just a positive initial result but research as this shows that Alzheimer's is a disease that we can understand and cure.
After <unk> years, there is real hope for what can be achieved in the next 10 or 20 years.
But to grow that hope, to overcome Alzheimer's disease, we need help.
It's not scientists like me, it's about you.
We should be aware that Alzheimer's is a disease and that if we <unk> we can <unk>
In the case of other diseases, patients and their families have <unk> more research and <unk> pressure on governments, pharmaceutical industry, about scientists and <unk>
That was essential to advance the treatment of HIV in the late 1980s.
We see that same unit to beat cancer.
But Alzheimer's patients often can't talk about themselves.
And their families, the hidden victims of their loved ones day and night, they're often too much <unk> to go out and advocate for change.
So it really depends on you.
Alzheimer's is not in most cases a genetic disease.
Everybody with a brain runs the risk.
Today, there are 40 million patients like <unk> who cannot create the change they need to themselves.
<unk> talking about them, and help to demand a cure.
Thank you.
<unk> this article in the Indian <unk> <unk> in January of this year.
To fall in love with somebody, do this.
The article comes from a psychological study designed to create romantic love in the laboratory, and from my own experience when I test it at the last summer.
So the procedure is quite simple: two strangers will be <unk> to get 36 questions more and more personal and then both look at your eyes without talking for four minutes.
Here's a couple of questions of example.
Number <unk> If you could wake up tomorrow with a quality or skill, what would that be?
Number <unk> When was the last time you <unk> someone else?
And <unk>
<unk> that these are increasingly <unk>
Number <unk> <unk> really <unk> <unk> to your partner what you like about it, or her, I know very honest this time, and I gave things that you wouldn't say to somebody you've ever met.
When I came across this study a few years ago, one detail was really struck by attention, the <unk> that two of the participants had married six months later and invited all of the lab to <unk>
So, it was <unk> about this process of making romantic love, but of course, I was also <unk>
And when I had a chance to test this study, with somebody who knew not particularly well, I didn't expect to <unk>
But I thought it was a good story, and I thought it was a good story, so I sent it to a few months later.
That was published in January, and now it's already <unk> so I guess some of you may probably ask some of you -- they are still <unk>
And the reason I think you challenge this is because they've done this question over and over the last seven months.
And this question is just what I want to talk about today.
But let's go back to the subject.
A week before the article was <unk> the article was very nervous.
I'd been working on a romantic book in the last few years, so I had encouraged me to write about my experience in romantic love on my blog.
But a blog entry can come to a few hundred views as a lot, and those were usually just my Facebook friends, and I imagined that my article in the New York Times would probably be a thousand views.
And that came a good burden of attention in a relatively new relationship.
But I had no idea.
The article published on a Friday night, and already on a Saturday day, this happened in my <unk>
And the Sunday, my <unk> had been named Show and "Good Good <unk>
In a month, the article got over eight million pages, and I was, by saying something, little prepared for this kind of attention.
One thing is to foster trust writing honestly about <unk> experience, but another thing is to discover that life loving from one has been international news --  and that people around the world are really interested in the state of your new relationship.
And when people called it or <unk> what they did every day for weeks -- they always, first the same question: They still still together?
In fact, when I was preparing this talk, I made a quick search for the mailbox of my email with the phrase: <unk> remain <unk>
And several messages came up immediately.
They were from students and journalists and strangers <unk> like this.
I was being interviewed by radio and <unk>
I really gave a talk, and a woman screamed up to the stage, "Hey <unk> where is your <unk>
And I immediately put red.
I understand this is part of the deal.
If you write about your relationship in an international journal, you should expect people to feel comfortable asking about it.
But I wasn't prepared for the <unk> of the answer.
The 36 questions seemed to have <unk> life.
In fact, the New York Times published an article called <unk> in San <unk> who included the experiences of readers at the time to test the study in them with different degrees of success.
So, my first urge to all of this attention was to be very <unk> with my own relationship.
I said not every request that we both made a public emergence together.
<unk> television interviews, and <unk> orders for us two.
I think it was afraid I was afraid of becoming the <unk> icons of the <unk> process, a range that I didn't feel at all.
And I understand that people didn't want to know only if the study worked, they wanted to know if they really <unk> I mean, if it was able to produce <unk> love not just an adventure, but love, real love, love <unk>
But this was a question I didn't feel capable of answer.
My relationship had just a few months ago, and I felt, mainly that people posed the wrong question.
How do you know if you <unk> it together or not, and then <unk>
If the answer was no, I would do the experience of making these 36 questions less interesting?
Dr. Arthur <unk> wrote first about these questions in this same study in 1997. And there, the goal of researcher wasn't to produce romantic love.
Instead, I was looking at <unk> <unk> among university students, using what <unk> called <unk> and <unk> <unk> and <unk>
Sounds romantic, right?
But the study did work.
The participants felt closer after doing it, several later studies, they also used <unk> protocol <unk> as a quick way of creating trust and interaction between strangers.
They've been used between members of the police and the community, and they've used it among people of the opposite political ideologies of the community.
The original version of the story, which I tried last summer, which combines personal questions with four minutes of eye contact, was cited in this article, but unfortunately never published it.
A few months ago, I was giving a talk on a small liberal arts university, and then a student came up to me and told me to <unk> <unk> the study and didn't work.
He seemed <unk> for it.
And I said, "You want to say that you get rid of the person with whom you <unk>
Well he did a break.
I think she just wants to be friends.
And I said, "But they became better friends?
<unk> that did get better after test the <unk>
The <unk>
So, <unk> I said.
But I don't think that was the answer that he was looking for.
In fact, I don't think it's the answer that none of you are looking for when it comes to love.
I came across the study for the first time when I was 29 and I was going through a really difficult separation to it.
I had had that relationship since I had 20, which was mostly my adult life, and he was my first true love, and I had no idea how or if I could live without him.
So I took myself into science.
And I did all that I could find about the science of romantic love, and I hoped that it could sort of <unk> the heart.
I don't know if I realized that at the time, I thought I just was looking for the book that I was writing but in retrospect, it seems to really <unk>
I thought if I relate to the knowledge of romantic love, I would never have to feel as bad, and I used to feel like I felt then.
And all of this knowledge has been useful in a way or another.
I'm more patient with love, I'm more <unk>
I have more confidence to demand what it looks like.
But I can also look more clearly, and I can see that what I'm looking for is sometimes more than reasonably <unk> can be <unk>
What I'm looking for of love is an <unk> not just to be <unk> today and being <unk> tomorrow, but to continue to be <unk> by the person I love.
Maybe this is the guarantee that people would ask when they wanted to know whether we were still together.
The story that the media spoke about 36 questions is that there may be a shortcut to <unk>
There may be a way to somehow mitigate some of the risk of <unk> and this is a very <unk> story, because in love makes us feel beautifully, but it's also terrifying.
But I think when it comes to love, we're very willing to accept the short version of the story.
The story version that says, <unk> still together?
And their content with an answer of Yes or No.
So more than a question, let's say we ask questions more difficult questions like, how do you decide who deserves your love and who isn't it?
How to stay in love when things are <unk> and how to know when to cut and <unk>
How do you live with uncertainty that inevitably leads to a relationship? Or even more, how do you live with <unk>
I don't necessarily know the answers to these questions, but I think they're a good start to have a more <unk> conversation about what to love someone.
So if you want the short version of the story of my relationship, it's <unk> a year ago, a known one, and I apply a study designed to create romantic love, we still continue together, and I'm very <unk>
But they're not the same thing that will remain <unk>
<unk> is the easy part.
So at the end of my <unk> <unk> didn't happen.
<unk> in love because we took the choice to be.
And I <unk> a little bit to read it right now, not because it's not true, but because at the time, I hadn't considered everything that we were supposed to be.
I didn't think I would have both to make that decision, and how sometimes I will have to keep doing that choice without knowing before he always <unk> or not.
I want it to be enough to have done and responded to 36 questions, to have chosen to love somebody so smart and fun and have expressed that choice in the largest newspaper in the United States.
But what I've done instead is to turn my relationship into the kind of myth that I don't really think of.
And what I <unk> and what maybe I will spend my life looking for is that that myth is true.
I want the happy ending implicit in the title of my paper, which is by the way, the only part of the article that I didn't really like.
But what I have in change is the opportunity to choose someone, and the hope that he also love, and it's frightening, but that's a deal with love.
Thank you.
I was raised by some <unk> <unk> and in a certain way I came up as a forest <unk>
And something that really affected me for a time --  -- which really affected me but more details later on.
I'll start with when I was eight years old.
He took a box of wood, and he <unk> a dollar ticket a dollar, and a fork in it somewhere in Colorado.
And I thought that some strange <unk> or some aliens would find this box about 500 years later and <unk> how our species, <unk> ideas, for example how we eat <unk>
I had no idea.
Anyway, it has <unk> because here I am, 30 years later, and I'm still making boxes.
At a moment I was in <unk> <unk> like to go from a tour and <unk> and all of those things -- and I was doing a <unk> for my mother.
And I took a dictionary and took it all the pages and I took a kind of <unk> <unk> to the style Agnes <unk> I covered the covered and a bee <unk>
Well, my mother is afraid of bees and it's <unk> to them, so I put it on the canvas, thinking I could <unk>
Instead, the opposite: in some kind of way it seemed to grow up size, as if it were to <unk> the text with a <unk>
So I did? I built more boxes.
This time, I started adding electronic elements, frogs, strange bottles that I was finding on the street, all I could find, because I was looking for things all my life, trying to <unk> and tell stories about these objects.
So I started drawing around the objects, and I realized that my God can draw in space.
I can flow in the same way that you get around a dead body on the crime.
And I took objects out and I created my own taxonomy of specimens <unk>
First, <unk> that you can get an idea.
Then I did some insects and weird creatures.
It was really fun to draw in the layers of <unk>
And it was great, because I started building exhibitions and those things, and I was earning some money to bring my girlfriend to dinner, for example, going to <unk>
It was great, man.
At some point I got interested in human form, sculptures of natural size, with drawings of human beings within layers.
It was great, except for one thing: I was <unk>
I didn't know what to do, because I was going to kill it.
And I was going to bed every night thinking about it.
So I tried to use it.
I started drawing on the glass layers, similar to the drawing on a window and then on another window, and he had all these windows together who formed a three-dimensional composition of it.
And this really works, and so I could stop using the <unk>
So I did this for years, and my work <unk> with something very big -- I call <unk>
For the <unk> I was inspired by the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> which is a painting at the Museum of <unk> in Spain.
You know?
Well, it's a fantastic picture.
They say it's a little bit ahead of your time.
Well, the <unk> <unk> this piece.
It weighs 11 thousand pounds.
<unk> feet long.
It's got twice a face, so it's 10 meters of composition.
It's kind of weird.
Well, that's the source of blood.
On the left, it's Jesus and the <unk>
There's a cave where all of these creatures with animal heads travel between two worlds.
They're going from the world of representation, to this <unk> <unk> where they <unk>
This is where the creatures with animals are headed by <unk> lists to suicide <unk> in the ocean.
The ocean is comprised of thousands of elements.
This is a <unk> god tied to a <unk>
Billy Graham is in the <unk> The <unk> -- the <unk> platform of the <unk> <unk> the <unk> <unk> there are all sorts of weird things that you can find if you look very well in the ocean.
But also a kind of <unk>
It's coming out of the ocean, and it spits out oil in a hand while the other hand gets <unk>
Their hands are like <unk> and it seems to be <unk> that keeps the Earth and the cosmos in balance.
So it's a aspect of <unk>
It's a little bit a story.
That's the hand in which we <unk>
And then when you go to the other hand, it has a <unk> like a bird, and it spits out clouds of this <unk>
It also has a <unk> tail, a <unk> <unk> that unites the <unk>
Anyway, his tail fire fire on fire on a <unk>
I don't know why it happened.
Things that go by, you know.
His tail ends up in a <unk> eye of <unk> made from herd 1986.
They have <unk>
They did in the 1980s, as if they were baseball cards of terrorists.
Very <unk> at his time.  This brings me to my last project.
I'm in the middle of two <unk> One is called <unk>
This is a <unk> project to make 100 of these human beings.
Each one is an archive of our culture, through media and material is <unk> dictionaries or magazines.
But each one is acting as a kind of archive in a form of human being, and they travel into 20, four or 12 at a time.
They're like cells, they come together, they <unk>
And you can walk between them. I'm getting years old.
Each one is basically a <unk> microscope that weighs 1,300 pounds of a human being trapped inside.
This has a little cave on my chest.
That's the <unk> the chest. You can get the entry out.
I'm going to show you the rest of the body -- there's a waterfall that comes out of the chest, and you cover the penis or <unk> or whatever you have, a kind of <unk> thing.
It's a quick refresher on these works because I can't afford it for a long time.
We have layers, you can see.
This is a <unk> body.
This has two heads and is communicating between the two.
There are some pills that come out and come into the head of this strange <unk>
There's a little forest on the <unk> <unk>
Can you <unk>
Anyway, this talk is about these <unk> just like the boxes we live in.
We're in a box, the solar system is a box.
This brings me to my last box.
It's a brick. It's called <unk> <unk>
Within this box there is a physicist, a neuroscientist, a painter, a musician, a musician, a <unk> a museum, a museum, an editorial arm that spreads all the content we do in the world, and a garden.
We <unk> the box and all the people in the inside hits each other as particles.
And I think that's the way to change the world.
When one <unk> who is and the box that you're living in.
And together we get to realize that we're all together in this, that this illusion that we're different, these concepts of countries, of the borders, it doesn't work.
We're all very made of the same matter and in the same box.
And if we didn't start exchanging those things with fine and <unk> we're all going to die very soon.
Thank you very much.
What do they do when you hurt your head?
They take a <unk>
But for this pill to have an effect against pain, first of the stomach, the <unk> and other organs.
To take a pill is the most effective system and <unk> so that any medicine will actually change the body.
The <unk> though, is that the <unk> any drug was <unk>
And this is a big problem, especially in HIV patients.
When you take drugs that are <unk> these are going to decrease the number of viruses in the blood, and to increase the immune cells.
But they are also known for their side effects <unk> in their most negative, because in the time that it takes to get to the blood stream is <unk> and worse than the time that it takes to get to your destiny, which is where it's more important, in HIV <unk>
These are regions of the body like the <unk> <unk> the nervous system, the nervous system, the lungs, where the virus is <unk> and it doesn't go easily into the blood bloodstream.
However, after the disruption disruption can wake up and infect new cells.
This is the big problem with HIV treatment with the current drugs that are a <unk> treatment for <unk>
And one day, I sat down and I thought, "You know, I was going to get the treatment directly to the warehouse of the virus, without the risk of <unk> <unk>
As a scientific expert in <unk> the answer was in front of me: <unk> of course.
If you use it in <unk> for <unk> <unk> and diabetes diabetes, you can be used for anything else, including transportation transport for medication.
In fact, we're using pulses of laser to open or drill extremely small holes, which open and close almost immediately cells that are infected with HIV to introduce drugs.
The best people ask, "How is that <unk>
We sent a small laser and laser beam on the cellular cellular membrane by HIV while these cells are embedded in a liquid that contains the drug.
The laser cuts through the cell, whereas the cell absorbs the drug in a matter of microseconds.
Before you even know it, the hole is <unk> immediately.
We're testing this technology in vitro technology or on <unk> <unk> but the goal is to bring this technology into the human body, apply it to the human body.
"How is that <unk> <unk>
Well, the answer is: through a <unk> device.
With the first head, which is our laser, we're going to do a <unk> on the site of infection.
The second head, which is a camera, is going to be a <unk>
Finally, the third head, a <unk> that distributes the drug, it frees directly on the site of infection, whereas the laser is used again to keep open cells.
Well, this doesn't look like a lot of time.
But one day, if it's successful, this technology can lead to the total eradication of HIV in the body.
Yeah. A <unk> cure for HIV.
This is the dream of all researcher <unk> in our case, a laser <unk>
Thank you.
In the last decade, I've been studying armed groups, not <unk> organizations like terrorists, insurgents or <unk>
<unk> what these groups do when they're not <unk>
My goal is to understand better to these <unk> agents and study ways to encourage the transition from violent participation to <unk> <unk>
I do field work in the world of politics and in the library.
Understanding to these groups is key to solving almost all of the conflict in course, because the war has changed.
It used to be a dispute between states.
Not anymore.
Now it's a conflict between states and actors.
For example, of the <unk> peace arrangements between 1975 and 2011, <unk> signed up between a state, and a non-governmental actor.
So we have to understand these <unk> we even have to <unk> or <unk> in any process of successful conflict.
But how do we do that?
We have to know what motivates these organizations.
We know very well the reasons why they <unk> how they do, but nobody looks at what they do when they don't <unk>
The armed struggle and policies are not <unk>
It's all part of the same organization.
We cannot understand these groups, not much less <unk> without a global vision.
<unk> groups are complex organizations.
For example, <unk> <unk> known for their violent <unk> against Israel.
From its creation in the 1980s, <unk> has also established a political party -- a network of social services and a military device.
Similarly, the Palestinian <unk> known for his suicide attacks against Israel, also runs <unk> in Gaza since 2007.
So these groups make more than just shooting.
It's multitasking you.
We <unk> a complex machine -- <unk> radio stations, websites Internet web websites and strategies in social networks.
And here's the printed magazine magazine in English and published to <unk>
<unk> groups are also investing in a complex fundraising <unk> but by doing business <unk> for example, construction companies.
These activities are key.
They allow these groups to increase their strength, increase their funds, to recruit better and build their brand.
<unk> groups also do something else: they create stronger ties with their population investing in social services.
They build schools and run hospitals, put them on professional training programs.
<unk> offers all these services and more.
<unk> groups also try to conquer the population by offering something that the state is not <unk> and the protection.
The rise of the Taliban in a Afghanistan torn by war or even the beginning of <unk> <unk> can be understood by the efforts of these groups to provide safety.
Unfortunately, in these cases, security has a price <unk>
But usually to provide social services means to fill an empty void and a <unk> gap by the government, and allows these groups to strengthen and increase their power.
For example, the election election of 2006 of Palestinian <unk> cannot be understood without recognizing the social work.
It's a really complex scenario in the West, even in the West, when we look at <unk> groups, we just think of the violent side.
But that's not enough to understand the strengths of these groups, the strategy or the long-term vision.
These groups are <unk>
<unk> because they fill in <unk> gaps by government, and emerge as armed and political groups participate in nonviolent struggle and governance.
And the more complex and sophisticated things are these organizations, less we can <unk> them as opposite of a state.
How do we call a group like <unk>
<unk> part of a territory, and they run all of their function, collect <unk> running the <unk> system.
It's a state? It's a <unk> group.
Or maybe it's something else, something new and different.
And what is <unk>
The lines are <unk>
We live in a world of states of nations without state and hybrids and the weakest the states, like in the Middle East, and they fill that gap in the <unk> <unk> of the U.S. actors.
This is important for governments, because to counter these groups will have to invest more in military tools.
<unk> that <unk> government has to be in the center of any sustainable approach.
This is very important to establish and to build peace.
If we understand better groups at <unk> we will understand better what incentives to offer the transition from violence to violence.
In this new <unk> between states and actors, <unk> military power can earn some <unk> but we will not give us peace and stability.
In order to achieve these targets we need long-term investments to fill that security void to fill that <unk> government that allowed these groups to thrive in a principle.
Thank you.
I'm a failure as a woman and a feminist.
My opinions about gender equality is <unk> but I'm afraid to accept this openly <unk> it would be unfair to <unk>
I'm <unk> but quite bad.
And therefore I <unk> as a bad feminist.
Or at least I wrote an article and a book called "The <unk> and then on interviews, people started calling me the <unk> <unk>
So what started as a personal joke like a personal joke to me and a <unk> <unk> has become something larger.
Let me give you a step back.
When I was a young woman, especially in my youth and 20 years, I had strange ideas about <unk> these women <unk> <unk> with the men and <unk> sex.
Today, I see how women are treated and women all over the world and anger, in particular, seems a perfectly reasonable response.
But at the time, I was worried about the tone that I was using people to <unk> that might be a feminist.
It's kind of labeled a feminist <unk> a word and taboo and <unk>
I was <unk> as a woman who doesn't follow the rules, which is asked too much, with high self-esteem and <unk> to believe that it's equal or superior to a man.
No one wants to be that woman <unk> until you realize that it's actually the woman, and it can't imagine being another person.
Over time, as I was growing up, I started to accept that I am, in fact, and also proud to be.
For me, certain statements are <unk> women are equal to men.
They get the same wages for the same work.
We have right to travel around the world as <unk> free of <unk> or violence.
We have right to use easy and accessible to contraceptives and <unk>
We have the right to decide about our bodies, without needing for <unk> controls or <unk> <unk>
We have the right to the respect.
There's more.
When you talk about the needs of women, you have to keep in account our other <unk>
We're not just women.
We are people with a different body, expression of gender, religion and <unk> <unk> and skills and skills and skills.
We have to look at these differences and how we behave in the same way that matters what we have in common.
Without this kind of <unk> our feminism is nothing.
For me, these truths are <unk> but to be clear, I'm a disaster.
I'm full of contradictions.
There's a lot of things that make me a bad same.
I have another confession.
When I drive to work, I hear rap music, <unk> by volume.
Although the letter degrades women and offends me, the classic <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> is incredible.
<unk> actually with your <unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk> <unk> until you <unk> the <unk>
Think about it.
<unk> poetry, right?
I'm completely <unk> for my musical <unk>
I firmly believe in the work of man, which is all I don't want to do, <unk> --  -- all the <unk> tasks, but also kill insects, the <unk> and <unk> maintenance and <unk>
I don't want to have anything to do with that.
The pink is my favorite color.
<unk> from fashion magazines and <unk> things.
I can see "The <unk> and the <unk> <unk> and I have erotic fantasies about the <unk> fairy tales, which is reality.
Some of my crimes are more <unk>
If a woman wants to adopt the last name of her husband, it's his election, and I'm not who for <unk>
If a woman decides to stay home to raise her kids, I agreed that choice, as well.
The problem is not that it becomes economically vulnerable through this same choice, the problem is that our society is <unk> so that it makes women economically vulnerable when they <unk>
<unk> this problem.
<unk> the conventional feminism that has ignored it or <unk> historically the needs of color women -- the gay workers, the gay workers, <unk> for white women, <unk> <unk>
Listen, if that's good feminism -- I'm a very bad <unk>
It also happens to the following: Like <unk> I feel a lot of pressure.
We have this tendency to put <unk> <unk> in a <unk>
We hope that we <unk>
When we get rid of the <unk> with a lot of taste of the same <unk> where <unk>
As I said, I'm a <unk> I think of that <unk> before you try to put up there.
<unk> women, particularly the <unk> and the leaders of the sector, are afraid of being tagged as <unk>
They are afraid to stand up and say, "Yes, I'm <unk> for fear of what that works, for fear of not being able to fulfill the <unk>
Let's take <unk> or like I call it. The <unk>
In the last few years, it's a <unk> <unk>
In <unk> Music <unk> 2014, in <unk> <unk> in front of the word <unk> <unk>
It was a show of <unk> seeing this star in the pop star embrace the feminism and making the women and the young men who will be feminist is something to be proud of.
<unk> the time, critical critics began very endless discussions of endless <unk> if <unk> was not a feminist.
<unk> his feminism, rather than simply believing the word of an adult woman and <unk>
<unk> perfection because we're still struggling for a lot, we want a lot, we need so much, we need so much.
We go far beyond <unk> <unk> and <unk> to <unk> the feminism of any woman, <unk> until there's nothing.
We don't need to do that.
The bad feminism, or rather, feminism more <unk> is the point of <unk>
But what happens next?
We went to recognize our <unk> to the day, move to action and be a little bit more <unk>
If I hear music <unk> I'm creating a demand for artists that would be happier that happy providing a <unk> supply.
These artists will not change their way to talk about women in their songs until they <unk> the change actually affecting their profit.
It certainly is hard.
Why does their music have to be so <unk>
It's hard to pick up something better and so easy to justify a worse choice.
But when the bad decisions give this that it makes it be more difficult for women to achieve equality, equality that we all deserve and is our responsibility.
I think of three and four years old.
These are two <unk> <unk> <unk> and very <unk> I want you to grow up in a world.
And they were <unk> by strong creatures who are.
I think of them, all of a sudden, the best option <unk> as something much easier to do.
We can all make better decisions.
We can change the channel when a television program is dealing with sexual violence against women as a sport, <unk> the Game of <unk>
We can change the radio <unk> when we hear songs that treat women like anything.
We can spend our money to go to the cinema in another part of the time when movies don't treat women more than as <unk> objects.
We can stop supporting sports sports where athletes treat their companions as <unk>
In any case, men, especially male men -- heterosexual men may say, "No, I'm not going to post in your magazine, engage in your project, or work with you, until it doesn't include a number enough of women, so much to participate as to make decisions.
I'm not going to work with you until your <unk> or your organization is more <unk> with a wider range of people."
Those of us who are <unk> but they were able to participate in these sorts of projects, we can also recognize them to be even more like <unk> to overcome barriers to the decision seats.
Because we're not <unk> <unk> Without the efforts, without adopt these <unk> our achievements will mean very little.
We can make these small acts of courage and hope that our decisions come to the top, to people in power directors, and movie producers and music, <unk> <unk> the people who can make great decisions, more courageous, to create a durable and significant shift.
We can also say with courage our feminism, good, bad or any <unk>
The last line of my book <unk> <unk> says, <unk> will be a bad feminist to be in <unk>
This is true because of many reasons, but I tell you, especially because I <unk> my voice was <unk> and feminism helped me <unk>
There was one incident.
I call it incident to address what happened.
A couple of guys would tell me when I was too young, and I didn't know that kids can do this to a girl.
They tried to be nothing.
I started believing it was nothing.
I <unk> my voice, and after everything I didn't tell me to believe that I might matter.
But I was writing.
And I went back to <unk>
I was <unk> into a stronger version of myself.
I read the words of those women who could understand a story like mine, and of the women who looked like me and understood what it meant to live in this world if you have the brown skin.
I read the words of the women who showed me that it was nothing.
I learned to write like them, and then I learned to write like myself.
I found my voice again, and I started to believe that my voice is powerful beyond what you can measure.
Through writing and the feminism, I also discovered that if I was a little brave -- another woman could hear me and look at me and see that none of us is nothing to try to tell us that we are.
In one hand, I have the power to achieve anything.
And in the other hand, I have the <unk> reality that I'm just a woman.
I'm a bad <unk> I'm a good <unk> I'm trying to improve my way of thinking, what I say and what I do, without abandoning everything that makes me human.
I hope we all can do the same thing.
I hope that we can all be a little courageous, when more it takes such a <unk>
Just after Christmas last year, I was <unk> kids in California -- they had <unk> by having visited <unk> or being exposed to somebody who had been there.
The virus then went through the border to Canada, <unk> over 100 children in <unk>
One of the <unk> things about this outbreak is that <unk> which may be lousy for a child with an immune system, is one of the most easily diseases in the world.
There's an effective vaccine against this for more than half a century -- but many of the kids involved in the <unk> outbreak were not <unk> because their parents were afraid of something that was supposed to be <unk>
But a moment, it was not the article that sparked the argument about autism and vaccines and <unk> <unk> and marked by being a <unk> fraud, by the British Medical Park.
It doesn't believe most intelligent scientists that cause vaccines cause autism is a <unk>
I think most of you know, but millions of parents around the world remain <unk> that vaccines put in danger to their children of having autism.
Why?
Here's why.
This is a graph of the increase of autism in the time.
For most of the 20th century, autism was considered a very strange disease.
And the few psychologists and pediatricians who had heard about it creating his whole life without seeing one case.
Over decades, the prevalence is prevalence only three or four children per <unk>
But then, in the 1990s, the numbers began to <unk>
<unk> of fundraising as <unk> <unk> refer to autism as an epidemic as an epidemic as if I could <unk> another child in <unk>
What's going on?
If you're not vaccines, what is it?
If you ask people at the heart of Disease Control in Atlanta, what's going on, tend to be based on phrases like <unk> diagnostic <unk> and "an <unk> detection to explain these <unk> figures.
But that kind of language doesn't <unk> a lot of the fears of a young mother who seeks to look in the face of his son of two years, visual contact.
If the diagnostic criteria had to be <unk> why they were so <unk> by the beginning?
Why were the cases of autism so hard to find before the <unk>
Five years ago, I decided to figure out the answers to these questions.
I learned that what happened has less to do with the slow progress of the science that with the <unk> power of storytelling.
For most of the 20th century, the doctors told a story about what autism is and how it was discovered, but that story turned out to be fake, and the consequences of the same are having a devastating impact on global public health.
There was a second more accurate story of autism that had lost and forgotten in the dark corners of the clinical literature.
This second story tells us everything about how we get here and where we have to go.
The first story starts with a <unk> Leo <unk> at Johns Hopkins Hospital. In <unk> <unk> published an article that describes 11 young patients who looked at 11 young patients who looked <unk> <unk> <unk> to the people around their own parents.
They could have fun for hours by waving for hours by waving their faces, but they were <unk> <unk> like when he didn't put his favorite toy in his usual place without knowing them.
On the basis of the patients treated in their clinic, <unk> <unk> that autism is very weird.
By the 1950s, as the main authority of the world on the subject, declared that I had seen less than 150 true cases of their syndrome, while we were to <unk> references from places as far as South Africa.
This is actually no wonder, because <unk> criteria for autism diagnosis were very <unk>
For example, <unk> giving that diagnosis to children with <unk> but now we know that epilepsy is very common in autism.
Once he was <unk> that he had turned to nine in every 10 children sent by other doctors to his doctor's office to be autistic without giving you a diagnosis of autism.
<unk> was a smart man, but part of his theories were not <unk>
<unk> autism as a form of <unk> child caused by cold, cold parents.
These kids, he said, they've kept it carefully in a refrigerator that doesn't exist.
At the same time, nonetheless, <unk> noticed that some of his young patients had special skills that cluster in certain areas like music, math and memory.
One of the kids in their clinic could distinguish between 18 <unk> before I turned two years.
When his mother put one of his favorite records. He correctly said, <unk>
But <unk> had a bad opinion of these skills, affirming things like the children were simply <unk> what they heard of their parents who had heard their parents <unk> desperate to win their <unk>
As a result, autism became a source of embarrassment for families, and two generations of autistic children were sent to institutions for itself to the invisible in general.
Amazingly, it wasn't until the decade of 1970, the researchers started testing the <unk> theory that autism was weird.
<unk> <unk> <unk> cognitive psychologist, thought that the theory of mothers <unk> was pretty stupid.
She and her husband John were warm and <unk> and they had a daughter autistic daughter called <unk>
<unk> and John knew how hard it was to raise a child as <unk> without special education, no special education, no special access to other resources without a diagnosis.
To defend the National Service, they needed more resources for autistic children, and their families, <unk> and his colleague, Judith Gould decided to do something that should have been done for 30 years before.
They launched an prevalence of autism prevalence in the general population.
<unk> a suburb of London called <unk> to try to find the autistic boys in the community.
What they saw made sure that the <unk> model was too limited, because the reality of autism was much more <unk> and diverse <unk>
Some children couldn't speak at all, whereas others were <unk> in their fascination by astrophysics, to dinosaurs or <unk> <unk>
In other ways, these children didn't fit in nice <unk> and <unk> as <unk> said, and they saw a lot of them, much more than the <unk> model of <unk> would have predicted.
At first, they were lost to try to make sense of their data.
How did no one had ever noticed these kids before?
But then <unk> found a reference to an article published in German <unk> the next year to the article <unk> and then he was <unk> buried under the ashes of a terrible time that nobody wanted to remember.
<unk> knew about this article in the competition, but I avoided <unk> <unk> in their own work.
There was not even one translation of English, but luckily, the husband of <unk> spoke German, and he was <unk> for her.
The document offers an alternative story of autism.
His author was a man named Hans <unk> who was leading an integrated clinic with a school in Vienna, in the 1930s.
<unk> ideas for teaching children children with learning differences were <unk> even for contemporary standards.
The morning in his clinic started with <unk> exercises with music, and kids kept their games on Sunday afternoon.
Instead of blaming the parents of autism autism described as a <unk> disability, of life that required <unk> forms of support and <unk> spaces for the course of all life.
Instead of treating children in their clinic as patients, she calls them their little teachers, and it went to help in developing methods of education that were especially right for them.
<unk> has seen autism as a diverse continuum that included an amazing variety of gifts, and disabilities.
He believed that autism and the autistic traits were common and they've always been, looking at aspects of this continuum in <unk> culture as the awkward social scientist and Professor <unk>
He was beyond even to say, that for success in science and art, an ounce of autism is essential.
<unk> and Judith found that <unk> was wrong when autism was <unk> as well as the parents were <unk>
Over the next few years, they worked in silence with the American Association of <unk> to expand the criteria of the diagnosis that reflect the diversity of what they called <unk> <unk>
By the late '80s and principles of the '90s, their changes in <unk> <unk> the limited model of <unk> by a broad <unk>
These changes don't fell into broken <unk>
<unk> when <unk> and Judith was working between <unk> to reform these <unk> people around the world to see an adult adult for the first time.
Before he came out, <unk> <unk> in 1988, just a little circle, <unk> by experts knew what autism was. But after <unk> acting from <unk> <unk> as <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> and <unk> and fathers around the world knew what autism.
At the same time, they were introduced to the first simple clinical trials to diagnose autism.
I didn't have to have a connection with that little circle of experts to get a diagnosis for her son.
The combination of <unk> <unk> changes in the criteria and the introduction of these tests created an effect of network, a perfect storm of autism.
The number of diagnostics started <unk> as they predicted <unk> and <unk> in fact they hoped that this is what the people with autism and their families finally <unk> the support and services that are <unk>
So Andrew <unk> got to blame vaccines by the rise of the <unk> and a simple, powerful, <unk> history as bad as the <unk> theory that autism was <unk>
If the current estimate of prevention center that one of every 68 children in the United States are in the spectrum, is right one of the world's biggest groups in the world.
In the last few years, autistic people have come together on the Internet to reject the idea that the puzzles are because of the new breakthroughs -- <unk> the term <unk> to celebrate the varieties of human cognition.
One way to understand <unk> is to think about human operating systems.
The fact that a PC doesn't work with Windows -- it doesn't mean it's <unk>
According to <unk> standards, the normal human brain is easily <unk> social <unk> and having a deficit deficit <unk>
<unk> people have difficulty living in a world not built for them.
70 years later, we're still getting <unk> which believed that <unk> for the most <unk> aspects of autism are found in the understanding of teachers, employers with capacity, communities, communities of support, and parents with faith in the potential of their children.
An autistic woman named <unk> <unk> once once said, "We need all the hands on cover to <unk> the ship of <unk>
As we go towards an uncertain future, we need all the forms of human intelligence on the planet to address the challenges that we face as society.
We can't afford to waste any brain.
Thank you.
