You know that what I do is write for the kids, and in fact, I'm probably the author for a child, reading in the United States.
And I always tell people that I don't want to look like a scientist.
I can <unk> as a farmer, or with a leather <unk> and nobody has chosen a farmer.
I'm here today to talk about circles and <unk>
And you know that an epiphany generally is something that fell somewhere else.
You just have to go back to the apple to see it as a <unk>
That's the painting of a circle.
A friend of mine did that -- Richard <unk>
It's the kind of complicated circle that I'm going to talk about.
My circle began in the <unk> years in the middle school, in <unk> Ohio where I was the rare <unk>
When I walked up to bleeding every week in the bathroom of the boys, until a teacher saved my life.
She saved my life when she got into the bathroom of the teachers.
I was doing it by secret, right?
For three years.
And I had to go out of the city.
He had a thumb, 85 dollars, and I ended up in San Francisco, California -- I found a lover -- and in the <unk> I felt the need to start working in organizations that fight AIDS.
About three or four years ago, half of the night I got a phone call from <unk> Mrs. <unk> who said, "I need to see you.
I'm <unk> that of adults never got to know us.
You could go to Ohio and please bring that man that I know you've found.
And I have to tell you I have a <unk> ovarian cancer, and I'd like you to stand with this please."
Well, the next day we were in <unk>
And we went to see, <unk> <unk> and realized that she needed to be <unk>
We found a place, and the <unk> and the <unk> and the <unk> of his family, because I was needed.
It's something we knew how to do.
And so as the woman I wanted to <unk> as an adult came to <unk> he turned into a box of ashes and put on my hands.
And what happened was that the circle was closed, had turned into a circle -- and that epiphany of which I talked to them is made itself in itself.
<unk> is that death is part of life.
She saved my life, my partner and I save it.
And you know that part of life needs everything that the rest of life.
It needs truth and beauty, and I'm really happy that today I talked a lot about this.
It also needs -- needs dignity, love and pleasure. And it's our job to provide those things.
Thank you.
As an artist, the connection is very important to me.
Through my work, I'm trying to express humans that humans are not separated from nature and everything is interconnected.
I first went to Antarctica almost 10 years ago, and there I saw my first <unk>
I was <unk>
My heart can quickly, was <unk> trying to understand what was in front of me.
I would rolling it up to me about the <unk> of the water almost 60 feet, and I couldn't think that it was about a <unk> on another <unk> of snow year after year.
<unk> are born when you fall out of the glaciers or the walls of the ice.
Each iceberg has its individual personality.
They have a different way of interacting with their environment and their experiences.
Some of them refuse to give up and they are clinging to the end, whereas others can't afford them more and <unk> in a <unk> passion <unk>
It's easy to think, when you see a <unk> that are isolated separated and alone, as we see us sometimes as humans.
But the reality is the opposite.
As a <unk> <unk> I'm breathing its atmosphere <unk>
As an iceberg melts out of an iceberg the rich of minerals that feeds many forms of life.
I come back to photograph these <unk> as if it would be the portraits of my ancestors, so knowing that in these unique moments exist in that way and won't come back to exist again.
It's not the death when it's <unk> it's not an end, but one continuation of its way through the cycle of life.
Part of the <unk> ice that I photograph is very <unk> has a couple of thousands of years.
And another part of the ice is over 100,000 years old.
The last pictures I'd like to show you are a iceberg that I photographed in <unk> Greenland.
It's a little bit frequent to get to see an <unk> iceberg <unk>
Here they go.
You can see the left a little boat.
It's about five meters.
And I'd like you to pay attention to the shape of the iceberg and your <unk> line.
You can see here, it starts <unk> the ship has moved to the other side, and the man is standing there.
This is an <unk> iceberg <unk>
<unk> of the water about 120 feet or 40 feet.
This video is in real time.
And so <unk> the iceberg shows a different side of his personality.
Thank you.
I want you to imagine two couples in 1979, the same day, exactly at the same time, each <unk> a baby.
So, two couples each with a baby.
I don't want you to be <unk> too much in the details of conception, because if they stop to think about the conception of themselves, I'm not going to pay attention to me.
Let's think about that for a moment.
And on this stage I want you to imagine that, in a case, the chromosome and the sperm comes together to the X X <unk>
And in the other case, the X chromosome is attached to the X X <unk>
They both <unk> and start life.
We'll return to them later.
On my land that I can do two roles.
In one of my <unk> I work with the story of anatomy.
I'm a <unk> in training and what I study in this case is the way people <unk> the anatomy -- they say, human bodies and <unk> how have you considered <unk> <unk> the idea of the <unk> what have you thought about the body.
The other role that I do in my work is an activist, as an activist, like <unk> of patients or, as I say sometimes <unk> <unk> people who are medical patients.
In this case, I've been working with people whose physical features defy social norms.
I've been working on, for example, <unk> twins two people inside a body.
I've been working with people with <unk> people much lower than average.
And I've worked with many cases of people with sex <unk> individuals whose physical population doesn't fit in the male and female <unk>
In general, we can <unk> <unk>
<unk> adopt many ways.
I'm going to give you a few examples of ways of having a sex that doesn't fit into the common forms or male forms of male form.
For example, there is the case of the individual <unk> <unk> <unk> whose <unk> gene, and says to the <unk> that we all have in life that will become <unk>
And then, in <unk> life, the testes are producing testosterone.
But because this individual lacks testosterone, the body is not reacting to itself.
It's <unk> syndrome.
So, there are high testosterone levels.
As a result, the body develops following a <unk> course is <unk>
When he <unk> the baby is a little bit of a child.
It's a little girl. It's raised as a child.
And often, it's not until puberty, when it's growing and developing breasts but it doesn't have the menstrual period, when someone realizes something is happening.
And after <unk> you realize that instead of having <unk> and <unk> it actually has testicles and a chromosome.
The important thing to understand is that you can think about a man, but it's not really like that.
Women, like men, like men, we have in the body, something called <unk>
They're in the back of the body.
The <unk> glands produced <unk> the <unk> hormone.
Most women like me -- I think a <unk> woman doesn't know his structure, and I think it's a typical woman, most women like me are sensitive to <unk>
We create <unk> and we respond to the <unk>
As a result, someone like me has the most exposed brain to <unk> than the woman who was born with testicles who have <unk> <unk>
So sex is a complicated thing. It's not that <unk> are in the middle of the <unk> in some form you can be everywhere.
Another example, a few years ago I got a call from a <unk> <unk> and raised as <unk> he had girlfriend, and sex with her, he had a life as a boy and he had just figured out he had <unk> and <unk>
He had an extreme form of a disease known as <unk> <unk> <unk>
He had 20th chromosomes and in the uterus the <unk> glands were so active that essentially created a male hormone environment.
As a result, their <unk> were <unk> their brain was exposed to hormone component, typically male.
He was born with <unk> nobody <unk> anything.
And it was the 19 years when he started having the medical problems caused by the internal <unk> when doctors discovered that, in fact, was a woman inside.
Well, another example of a case of <unk>
Some people with 20th chromosomes develop what's known as <unk> is to say, they have tissue <unk> wrapped in tissue.
We don't know why that happens.
So, there are many varieties of sex.
The reason that children with these kinds of bodies are <unk> <unk> twins or <unk> <unk> surgery -- it's not to have a better physical health power.
In many cases, people are perfectly healthy.
The reason why it comes to various surgeries is that they are a threat to our social categories.
The system is based on the idea that a particular anatomy brings together, a particular identity.
We have the idea that being woman is having <unk> identity, <unk> being black means to have African anatomy in the historical terms.
A very simplistic idea.
And when you present a body that shows something quite different, we have trouble with <unk>
So we have very <unk> ideas in our culture about <unk>
Our nation is based on a concept of <unk> very romantic.
Imagine how amazing it is to have kids that are born as two people within a body.
The most recent case is last year with the South African <unk> South <unk> <unk> put on <unk> sex in the <unk> <unk>
A lot of reporters were called to wonder: "What test are you going to do to determine whether <unk> <unk> is man or <unk>
And I had to explain to you to the reporters that don't have such a test.
In fact, we now know that sex is so complicated that we have to admit that nature doesn't traces a <unk> line between men and women or <unk> and women and <unk> are us who we draw that line.
So what we have is a situation where the more we go through science, we have to admit that these categories were -- we were thinking about these categories were <unk> <unk> categories that are <unk> directly into <unk> categories that are much more <unk> than they were <unk>
And not just in terms of sex.
Also in terms of race, something that is much more complicated than the terminology <unk>
As we see, we get into a <unk> ground.
<unk> for example, the fact that we share at least 95 percent of the DNA with chimpanzees.
What about the fact of <unk> of them in just a few <unk>
And as we grow in science we get more and more in a uncomfortable zone where we have to recognize that <unk> categories are probably too <unk>
And we're looking at this in all walks of human life.
One of them, for example, in our current culture today, in the United States today, are <unk> at the beginning and in the end of life.
It's hard to set up a moment from which a body becomes human and has different rights to the <unk>
There are very <unk> discussions today -- not in public, but it's inside the <unk> about when someone is considered dead.
Our ancestors never had to engage with this question of whether someone was dead.
As a lot of him put a pen in front of the nose, and if he moved on it, he still won't.
If I stopped moving the <unk>
But we can, for example, extract vital organs from a body and put them in another body.
And as a result, we have to deal with a dilemma to determine somebody's death, and that puts us in a difficult situation where we don't have the simple categories of the past.
And maybe think that this categories of categories could be celebrating someone like me.
In politics I'm progressive, <unk> people with unusual bodies, but I have to admit that I get nervous.
<unk> that these categories are much more fragile than we thought <unk>
<unk> from the concept point of view of the concept of democracy.
And to tell you about this tension first, I have to admit that I'm a fervent <unk> of the Founding <unk>
I know they were <unk> I know they were <unk> but they were big.
I mean, they were so brave and bold, and so radical and so radical in what they did, which I find myself each so much watching that piece of music, <unk> <unk> and not by music, which is totally <unk>
That's what happened in <unk> with the Parents <unk>
<unk> <unk> were, for me, the first activists of the anatomy and I explain why.
What they <unk> was a <unk> concept.
And as we all remember, what we <unk> our <unk> <unk> was the idea of <unk> The monarchy was based on a very simplistic concept of anatomy.
The monarchs of the old world didn't know the DNA, but they had clear the idea of birth to birth.
They had the concept of blue blood.
They were from the idea that the political power was coming into the right of blood passed from the grandfather to the father and then the son, etc.
The Founding <unk> rejected that idea and replaced it for a new <unk> concept, and that concept was that all men are created equal.
They <unk> the game field and they decided that the anatomy that mattered was the common anatomy and not the differences, that was very radical.
And partly they were doing it because they were part of a <unk> system where they were <unk> two things.
It was <unk> democracy and the same time <unk> science.
And there's very clear, if you look at the story of <unk> <unk> that many people were very interested in science and in the idea of a <unk> world.
They were <unk> out of the <unk> explanations and therefore <unk> the concept of <unk> power went from a vague idea of birth.
They were moving towards a <unk> concept.
And if you look at it, for example, the Declaration of Independence and talk about nature and the god of nature.
They don't talk about God and the nature of God.
They talk about the power of nature to tell us who we are.
And in a result, they were passing the idea of <unk> <unk>
And in doing so, they were <unk> the foundations of the future rights movement <unk>
They didn't think of it, but they did it for us and it was great.
And what did it happen next?
And women <unk>
Then the success of the Civil Rights Movement with people from the <unk> <unk> who said, "I'm not a <unk>
We found men in the rows of the Civil Rights movement, saying, "I'm a man."
And again, people of color that are going to <unk> the <unk> <unk> and again, <unk>
We see the same with the Movement of <unk>
The problem is, of course, as we look at <unk> we need to start asking ourselves why we keep certain <unk>
But attention, I want to keep some <unk> <unk> in our culture.
For example, I don't want to give a fish the same rights that a human being.
I don't mean that we should be <unk> at anatomy.
I don't mean to say that at the age of five they were allowed to have sex or get married.
There are some <unk> <unk> that for me to make sense and I think we should be <unk>
But the challenge is to try to figure out what they are, why to keep them and make sense.
Well, let's go back to those two <unk> <unk> at the beginning of this talk.
We have two <unk> both <unk> in the <unk> exactly the same day.
Imagine that one of them, Mary, was born three months before I time: June 1, 1980.
Henry, on the contrary, was born in term, was born March March 1980.
By the only fact that I was born three months before Mary are attributed to all the rights three months before Henry <unk> entitled right to sexual consent -- the right to vote, the right to <unk>
Henry has to wait for all of that not because it has a different biological age, but because he was born afterwards.
We found other <unk> relative to their rights.
Henry, in virtue of being considered a man -- whether I haven't told you whether it's <unk> in virtue of being considered to be a <unk> <unk> that Mary doesn't have to worry about.
<unk> on his hand, doesn't have the same rights that Henry in all states, for example.
Henry can marry all states with a woman, but Mary can marry a woman in some states.
So we still have <unk> categories that in various ways are <unk> and questionable.
And now the question is, what do we do now that science went so much in the field of the anatomy that we get to the point of having to admit that a democracy based on the anatomy could be.
I don't want to give up the science, but at the same time, sometimes I feel like science <unk>
Where do we go from here?
It seems that what happens in our culture is a kind of <unk> attitude -- "Well, we have to draw the line somewhere, so we're going to do."
But a lot of people are stuck in a strange position.
For example: Texas at a certain point has decided that to marry a man you don't have to have chromosome and to get married with a woman you have to have <unk>
Now, in practice, they don't make tests to be <unk>
But this is also very strange because the story I told you at the beginning of the <unk> syndrome.
If we look at one of the founding parents of modern democracy, Dr. Martin Luther King, in his speech "I wish <unk> <unk> offers a solution.
It says that we should judge people <unk> not in the color of their skin but in the content of their <unk> going beyond anatomy.
And I want to say, "Yes, the idea looks good.
But in practice, how do you do it?
How do people judge the basis of their <unk>
I want to point out that I'm not sure that I'm not sure that we should be <unk> in this to <unk> rights to people, because I have to admit that I know from some <unk> <unk> who probably deserve more social services than I know.
I also want to say that maybe some <unk> that I know can make more intelligent and smart decisions about their sex relationships than people than we ever know.
So how do we put the theme of the content of <unk>
It turns out very hard.
And a part of me wonder what would happen if the character of a person could be measured with an instrument, maybe with an MRI.
We want to really get to that point?
I'm not sure where we go.
What I do know is that it seems to be very important that the United States is still going to keep driving this current of thinking relative to the issue of democracy.
We've done a good job in defense of democracy and I think we're going to do a good job in the future.
We don't live, for example, in a context like Iranian in which a man who feels attracted to other men is susceptible to a <unk> unless he is willing to be <unk> at least it's willing to be a living.
We're not in that situation.
I'm glad to say that we don't have a context like the surgeon that I talked about a couple of years ago that had made birth <unk> <unk> to pick them up and then <unk> his fame.
But when the phone asked her the question of the operation, he was a very <unk> operation -- he said that in that other country these children would be very <unk> and therefore I had to do it.
And I said, "Well, it's considered the political asylum instead of separation <unk>
The United States offers huge possibilities for people to be <unk> to change for the good of the state.
So I think we need to be on the head.
Well, I just want to say I've been talking a lot about <unk>
And I want to think about how democracy would be democracy, or as it might have been, if we had given greater participation to the <unk>
And I want to say something a little radical to a <unk> and that is that I think there may be different ideas from different <unk> <unk> particularly if there are people thinking about groups.
For years, since I've been interested in <unk> I've also been interested in investigating the sexual <unk>
And one of the things that I'm interested in is the differences between men and women in terms of how to think and operate in the world.
And what we know about <unk> studies is that women, on average, -- not all, but in <unk> they tend to pay more attention to complex social relationships and to deal with those who are <unk> within the group.
And if we think about that, we have an interesting situation in our hands.
And years ago, when I was in graduate school, one of my advisers who knew that I was interested in feminism <unk> I considered <unk> as a <unk> and he made me a <unk> <unk>
<unk> what about female <unk>
And I thought, "This is the stupidest question I've ever heard.
Feminism has to be able to get rid of the feelings of gender, so there's nothing female in the <unk>
But the more I thought about your question, the more I have seemed to have something like something female in the <unk>
I mean, there might be something, on average, something different between the female brain and the male that makes us more <unk> to complex social relationships and willing to help the most vulnerable.
So while the parents were very attentive to find the way to protect the people from the state, it may be possible that, to have more <unk> to this concept, maybe we have enriched the concept of protection with <unk> <unk>
And maybe that's what we need to do in the future when we <unk> democracy beyond the individual thinking less in the individual body, in terms of identity, and to think more about relationships.
So while we try to create a perfect <unk> let's think about what we do about each other.
Thank you.
In 2007, I decided we had to rethink how we think about economic development.
Our new goal should be that when every family thinks where they want to go to live and work, have the possibility to choose between at least a handful of different cities that are competing for attracting new residents.
Well, right now, we are far away from that goal.
There are billions of people in developing countries that don't count a single city willing to <unk>
But the amazing thing about cities is that they are worth much more than their building cost.
So we could easily <unk> the world <unk> maybe hundreds of new cities.
Well, this may sound absurd if you've never thought about new cities.
But they just <unk> by buildings from apartments.
Imagine that half of those who wanted to live in apartments were already owners, and that the other half is still not restricted to do it.
They could try to increase the ability to <unk> in all the existing buildings.
But you know that the problem that <unk> is that those buildings and the areas that surround them have rules to avoid the <unk> and the <unk>
So it would be very difficult to do all those <unk>
But they could go to a totally new place, building a whole new apartment building -- and when the rules of that place is going to build it rather than <unk>
So I suggested that governments were going to have new reform zones for large cities to contain cities and gave them a name, <unk> cities.
Later I found out that more or less at the same time, <unk> and <unk> were thinking about the challenge of reforming Honduras.
Did you know that every year about 75,000 <unk> of their country to go to the United States, and they wanted to ask, what could they do to ensure that those people could stay and make those same things in Honduras.
In the summer of 2009, <unk> country happened by a constitutional constitutional crisis.
In the following election, <unk> <unk> <unk> had a platform on a platform in which <unk> reforms and at the same time reconciliation.
He asked <unk> to be his head of <unk>
Meanwhile, I was preparing to give a talk in TEDGlobal.
Through a process of <unk> trial and error and a lot of evidence with users, I tried to reduce this complicated concept of cities under <unk> to their most essential.
The first point was the importance of the rules, like those rules that say you can't go and go to all the current residents of apartments.
It takes a lot of attention to new technologies, but it takes so much of technologies like <unk> and usually the rules that prevent us forward.
In the fall of 2010, a friend of Guatemala sent him a link to the <unk>
I showed it to <unk>
They name me.
They said, <unk> this to the leaders of our <unk>
So in December we met <unk> in a conference room in a hotel.
I tried to explain to you this point about how valuable the cities, much more valuable than their cost <unk>
And I used this image that shows the value of the land in a place like New York <unk> land that in some cases, are worth thousands of dollars per square meter.
But it was a pretty abstract discussion and at some point, when there was a pause, <unk> said, <unk> maybe we could see the video of the <unk> talk.
And the talk described me in very simple terms that a city under <unk> is a place where it starts with <unk> <unk> a <unk> which <unk> the rules that are <unk> there and an option so that people can choose if they want to go or not live under those norms.
So the president of <unk> he called me and told me that we had to do this project, this is important, this could be the way our country forward.
He asked me to be <unk> and I would talk about the four and five of January.
So I presented another talk filled with data, which included an image like this, which was trying to explain that to make a lot of value to a city, this has to be very big.
This is a photo of <unk> and the white line is the new airport that was built in <unk>
Just this airport covers over 100 kilometers square.
So I was trying to convince the <unk> that to build a new city, we have to start with a place that is about 1,000 miles.
That's more than 100,000 <unk>
Everybody <unk> <unk>
The public faces were very serious and <unk>
The leader of Congress came up to the platform and said, "Professor <unk> thank you so much for his talk, but maybe we could see the video of the <unk> talk.
I have here in my <unk>
So I sat down and showed the <unk>
And this explained <unk> that a new city can provide new choices for people.
There would be a choice in a city that could go to be in <unk> rather than hundreds of miles from the north to the North
And they also <unk> new options for leaders.
Because the leaders of the <unk> government would need help from <unk> countries, could benefit from the countries that were helping them to establish and make the norms of the <unk> so that everybody could trust that <unk> actually <unk>
We went and we saw one site.
This picture is from there.
It could be <unk> a thousand square miles.
And little later, the 19 of January, they voted in Congress to <unk> their Constitution and add a foreign arrangement that would allow these very special regions of development.
In a country that had just passed through this <unk> crisis, the voting in Congress for this constitutional <unk> was from <unk> to one.
All the <unk> all the <unk> in society, the <unk>
To <unk> in the <unk> you have to pass two times in Congress.
On February 17 was approved again in the other voting -- to take one.
Immediately after the <unk> of 21, the <unk> of about 30 <unk> went to the two places in the world that are most interested in engaging in the building of cities.
One of them is South Korea.
This is a picture of a new big new city center that's being built in Korea is larger than the center of Boston.
Everything you see there was built in four years, after four years was getting the <unk>
The other country interested in building cities is Singapore.
In fact, they've already built two cities in China and they're preparing for a third.
And if you think about this <unk> this is the point where we are.
They have a place, and you're thinking about a site for the second city.
They're preparing a legal system that would allow the <unk> to <unk> and they would allow that to operate under an external legal system.
A country has already committed to allow his Supreme Court to be the court ultimately to this new <unk> system.
There are <unk> and builders of cities that are very interested in the project.
You can even get some funding.
But the only thing we know you've already solved is that they have a good number of people.
There are many companies that wanted to be installed in <unk> especially in a place with a free place, and there's a lot of people who would like to go live there.
In the world there are 700 million people who say they would like to change the other place.
There's one million a year when you come out of Latin America to go to the United States.
Many of them are parents who have to leave their family back to their family to get a job for a job -- sometimes they are mothers who have to earn the money to get money to eat or buy clothes.
Unfortunately, sometimes there are even kids who are trying to meet their parents who haven't seen, in some cases, in a decade.
So what does it look like to think about building a new city in <unk>
Or build a dozen of these, or a hundred of these all over the world?
What does it look like to think about to insist that families can choose between various cities that are competing for attracting new <unk>
This is an idea worth spreading.
And my friends <unk> I was asked to say, "Thank <unk>
I'm a <unk> and this is my <unk>
But before I show you what's inside, I'm going to make a public confession -- and that is, I live obsessed with <unk>
I love to find, and I love more recently, photographing and post in my blog <unk> and colorful and different for every year.
But I don't buy anything new.
My whole clothes is <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk>
Oh, thank you.
The second hand stores allow me to reduce the impact of my <unk> in the environment and my <unk>
I go to know people <unk> usually my money goes to a good <unk> My aspect is <unk> and buying it into my search for <unk>
I mean, what am I going to find today?
It will be my size?
<unk> like <unk>
It will cost less than 20 dollars?
If all the answers are positive, then I feel that I have won.
Going back to the theme of my <unk> I want to tell you what I was doing for this exciting week at TED.
I mean, what does it bring with you, someone who has all that <unk>
So I'm going to show you exactly what I suit.
I've brought seven nesting pairs inside, and nothing else.
<unk> inside exactly a week is everything I've put in my <unk>
I imagined that I would be able to find everything else that I'd like to use after you got here to Palm <unk>
And since I don't know how the woman who walks for TED in <unk>  That means I found some things.
And I'd like to show you now the sets for this week.
It doesn't sound interesting?
While I do, I'm also going to tell you some of the lessons of life that believe it or not, I've learned in this adventure of not using new clothes.
Let's start with Sunday.
I call this <unk> tiger <unk>
You don't have to spend a lot of money to look at it.
You almost can always see for less than 50 dollars.
All together, including the <unk> took me <unk> and is the most expensive thing I've used in the week.
<unk> color is energy.
It's almost <unk> impossible to be <unk> when you're wearing a brilliant red <unk>
If you're happy, you're going to attract other people happy.
<unk> The integration is <unk>
I've spent a lot of time in life trying to be myself and at the same time.
I just know yourself.
If you get rid of the right people, you don't just get rid of it, you will tell you.
<unk> <unk> of the child that you're inside.
Sometimes people tell me that it seems to play the <unk> or I remind you at the age of seven.
I like to <unk> and say, <unk>
<unk> trust is the key.
If you think you see you well with something, it's almost sure you are.
And if you think you don't see you well with something, it's probably true.
My mother taught me this day after day.
But it wasn't until the 30 years that I really understood its meaning.
And I'm going to explain in a few seconds.
If you think you're a beautiful person in your inside and outside, you don't see you can't <unk>
So there's no excuse for anybody in this audience.
We must be able to achieve everything we want to achieve.
Thank you.
<unk> A universal truth for you: <unk> <unk> go with everything.
And finally, <unk> <unk> a personal and only one is a great way to tell the world something about you without having to say a word.
I've tried it over and over again, when people were approaching this week just by what I was using, and we had fantastic conversations.
Now obviously this is not going to go into my little <unk>
So before I go home to Brooklyn, I will give you all.
Because the lesson that I'm trying to learn about this week is that we have to leave certain things.
I don't need <unk> emotionally to these things, because around the corner, there's always going to be another crazy, <unk> <unk> and brilliant <unk> if there's a little bit of love in my heart and I'm after.
Thank you very much.
Thank you.
This is a representation of your brain that we can divide in two parts.
The left-hand side, which is the logical part, and the right side, which is the intuitive.
So if you look at a scale to measure the <unk> <unk> we could design a blueprint for our brain.
For example, this would be somebody who is completely logical.
This would be someone that's totally intuitive.
So where do you get your brain at this scale?
Some <unk> by one of these extremes, but I think for most of the members of this audience, their brain is something like that, with a great <unk> in both <unk> at the same time.
It's not that it's mutually <unk>
You can be logical and intuitive.
I consider myself one of those people, that just like most of the other quantum physicists, <unk> we need a lot of <unk> to <unk> these complicated ideas.
But at the same time, we need rather intuition to make experiments really work.
How do we develop this <unk> Well, we like to play with things.
We put them to play with them and then look like <unk> and then we develop our intuition from that point.
And actually, you do the same thing.
As a intuition that you may have developed over the years is that it says that one thing can be just in one place at a time.
I mean, it may sound weird to think that one thing is in two different places at the same time, but you weren't born with this <unk> <unk>
I remember looking at a child playing in a parking <unk>
It was a small child, and I didn't do it very well, always <unk>
But I bet that playing with that bar of parking lot taught him a worthy lesson, and it is that big things don't allow the <unk> and they stay in a place.
This is a great conceptual model that you can have in the world, except to be a particle physicist.
It would be a terrible model for a particle physicist, because they don't play with the parking lot, play with these strange particles.
And when they play with their particles, they discover that they do all sorts of weird things -- like they can go through walls, or that they can be in two different places at the same time.
And then they wrote all these observations, and they called it theory of quantum mechanics.
And at that point there was the physics of a few years ago; you needed to collect quantum mechanics to describe those tiny particles.
But you didn't need to describe the big objects that surround us every day.
That didn't fit very well to my intuition, and maybe it's because not really play with particles.
Well, sometimes I play with them, but not a lot.
And I've never seen it.
I mean, nobody saw a <unk>
But it didn't fit well to my logic.
Because if it's all made of small particles and all the small particles follow the principles of quantum mechanics, then it shouldn't be on the principles of quantum mechanics ...
I don't find the reason why they don't should.
And so I would feel much better if I could somehow demonstrate that a common object is also following the principles of quantum mechanics.
That's why a few years ago, I proposed to do exactly that.
And I did.
This is the first object that you can see has been in a overlap of quantum mechanics.
What we see here is a little computer chip.
And you can try to see the green dot right in the middle.
That's the little bit of metal that I'm going to talk about in a minute.
This is a picture of the object.
And here's a little bit. It's just right at the center.
And then here we do a good approach to the small metal <unk>
What we see is a little bit of a little bit of metal, with a springboard shape and <unk> on a platform.
And so I did this almost as much as you would do a computer chip.
I went to a clean room with a new, new chip chip and I started to work all the big machines for about 100 hours.
For the last material, I had to build my own machine -- to do this <unk> <unk> which is located under the device.
This device has the ability to be in a quantum overlap but for that it needs a little bit of help.
Let me make an analogy.
You know how uncomfortable being on an elevator full of people.
I mean, when I'm on an elevator alone, I do all kinds of weird, but then when other people go up to do those things, because I don't want them to <unk> or, actually, <unk>
Quantum mechanics says that inanimate objects behave in the same way.
<unk> <unk> are not just people -- it's also the light that <unk> and the wind that goes on the side and the heat of the room.
So we knew that if we wanted this little bit of metal to turn to quantum mechanics, we'd have to <unk> all the other passengers.
And that's what we did.
<unk> the lights, then <unk> a <unk> and we pulled out all the air, and then it <unk> at a temperature of less than a degree above absolute zero.
Now, when you're just in the <unk> the little metal piece of metal is free of acting as I want.
So we measure their movements.
And we discovered that it was moving in very strange ways.
Instead of staying perfectly still, he was vibrating. And the way I <unk> was like a breath in this form -- as a <unk> that expands and <unk>
And when we give it a soft, <unk> we were able to make it <unk> and that we don't have at the same time -- something that only happens with quantum mechanics.
So what I'm telling you is something really fantastic.
What does it mean that one thing <unk> and not <unk> at the same time?
Let's think about the atoms.
In a case, all the trillion of the atoms that make up that piece of metal are still still and at the same time that same atoms are moving up and down.
It's just in certain <unk> when those <unk>
In the rest of the time they are <unk>
It means that every atom is in two different places at the same time, which means that all the metal piece is in two different places.
I think this is great.
Seriously.
<unk> <unk> in a clean room to do this for all those years, because, look at this, the difference on the scale between one atom atom and that little bit of metal is more or less the same little little bit of metal and you.
So if one single atom can be in two different places at the same time, and that piece of metal can be in two different places, why not you too?
I mean, it's my logical part.
So imagine if they were in several places at the same time, how would that be?
How do you act your consciousness if your body was <unk> in space?
There's another part of the story.
And it is when we <unk> it and we turned the lights and looked inside the box, we saw that the metal kept there in one piece.
And I could get to this new intuition, apparently all the objects on the elevator are actually just quantum objects that are just <unk> in a small space.
You hear a lot about what quantum mechanics claims everything is interconnected.
Well, that's not so true.
It's more profound.
It is that those connections, your connections to all the things around you, literally define who you are, and that's the deep strangeness of quantum mechanics.
Thank you.
My name is <unk>
And 18 months ago, I was doing another job at Google, until I launched the idea of doing something related to museums and art to my head that was here and allowed me to take it.
It took me 18 months and took me 18 months old.
And so many negotiations and stories, I was <unk> with 17 very interesting museums in nine countries.
But I'm going to focus on <unk>
There's a lot of stories about why we did.
I think my own story is explained just in this slide, and this is access.
I grew up in India.
<unk> of a great education -- not <unk> but I didn't have access to many of these museums and artwork.
So when I started traveling and go to museums, I began to learn a lot.
And working on Google, I try to really make the desire to make it more accessible by technology.
So we formed a team, a great team of people, and we started doing it.
You'd better show you the demo, so then I'll explain to you a couple of interesting things that we've done from its launch.
So <unk> we're going to <unk>
Look around all the museums that are.
There's the <unk> gallery <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
In fact, I'm going to go into one of my favorites, <unk> the art museum in New York.
There are two ways to do it -- very simple.
We click and <unk> we're inside the museum.
It doesn't matter where they are, <unk> or <unk> that doesn't really matter.
You move around and get <unk>
They want to navigate the <unk>
We open up the flat plane and with one click, we jumped in.
They're inside, they want to go at the end of the space.
We're going forward. It <unk>
<unk>
Thank you, but I haven't reached the best.
Now I'm in front of one of my favorite paintings, "The <unk> of Pieter <unk> in <unk>
I see the <unk> sign.
If the museum shows us the picture, we click there.
See, this is one of the images.
Here's all the <unk> information.
For those of you who are really interested in art, you can click there, but I'm going to click here right now.
And this is one of the images we've captured in what we call the <unk> technology.
So this picture, for example, I think, about 10,000 million pixels.
And there are many people who ask me, "What do you get with 10,000 million <unk>
So I'll show you what you really get with 10,000 million pixels.
You can zoom in around a very simple way.
You see things like that are happening.
I love this guy, his expression doesn't have any price.
But if you really want to <unk>
So I began to play, and I met with something that was happening there.
And I said, "Wait a minute, I said, <unk>
I walked into and discovered that the kids were actually playing something.
And I did a little bit, I talked to some of the <unk> and I actually discovered that this is a game called <unk> which is to hit a <unk> with a <unk> <unk>
And apparently it was very popular.
I don't know why they did, but I've learned something about it.
And now we're going to get further into depth and you'll see that you can actually reach the cracks.
Now just to give you a little bit of perspective, I'm going to take away the image, so you see really what it is.
Here's where we were, and this is the painting.
The best one is coming, a second.
So now we're going quickly to jump again to MoMA in New York.
Here's another one of my favorites, "The <unk>
The example I showed was to find details.
But what if you want to look at the <unk>
And if you want to see how Van Gogh actually created this <unk>
It increases it and really <unk>
I'm going to one of my favorite parts in this picture, and I'm really going to reach the cracks.
This is <unk> <unk> I think I'd never seen it before.
I'm going to show you another one of my favorite functions.
There's a lot of things here, but I don't have time to <unk>
This is the really cool part. It's called <unk>
All of you, absolute everyone, no matter whether it's rich or poor, or if you have a <unk> that gives you the same.
You can online to create your own museum, create your own collection from all these images.
It's very simple, we walked in.  I've created this function that I call "The <unk> of <unk> -- we just <unk> around.
It's about "The <unk> at the National Gallery, in London.
You can write things, send it to your friends and keep a conversation about what you feel about contemplating these <unk>
So in conclusion, I think to me, the main thing is that all the amazing things really don't come from Google.
No, in my view, they even come from museums.
Maybe I should not say this.
They actually come from those artists.
And that was my humble experience with this.
I mean, I hope that in this digital medium do justice to its artwork and that is represented properly online.
And the big question that you do today is, "You have done this to repeat the experience of going to a <unk>
And the answer is no.
It's to supplement experience.
And that's it. Thank you.
Thank you.
Good evening everybody.
I have something to show you.
So think it's a <unk> a pixel <unk>
In our lab we call it sensitive design.
I'm going to tell you a little bit about this.
If you look at this picture, I am from Italian, Italian, all the children in Italy are growing up with this photo on the wall of his bedroom. But the reason I'm showing you this is that has happened something very interesting in Formula careers -- one in the last two decades.
So some of the time, if you wanted to earn a <unk> race career, you take a budget and do it for a good pilot and a good car.
And if the car and the pilot were good enough, you made the race.
This is what in engineering, it was <unk> system control system.
It's essentially a system that has two <unk> a sensor and a <unk>
Now what's interesting is that the control systems in real time are starting to enter our lives.
Our cities, over the last few years, have been covered in networks and electronics.
They're becoming computer <unk>
And as <unk> are starting to respond differently and can be <unk> and <unk>
<unk> cities is a big thing.
As a minute, I wanted to mention that cities are only two percent of the Earth's cortex, but they represent 50 percent of the <unk> population.
75 percent of the <unk> consumption and to 80 percent of the CO2 emissions.
If we could do something with cities, it would be a big thing.
Beyond cities, all of these <unk> and <unk> are entering our everyday objects.
This is from an exhibit of <unk> <unk> for purposes at MoMA, during the summer.
It's called <unk>
Well, our objects, the environment, start <unk>
In a way, it's like all the existing atoms in existing <unk>
And that's changing the whole interaction that we humans have with the outside environment.
In some sense it's almost like the old dream of Miguel <unk>
You know, when Michelangelo <unk> the <unk> is said that the hammer took a hammer, and he threw it back to the Moses -- you can still see a little <unk> <unk> and he said, <unk> <unk> <unk> -- and what not <unk>
Well, today, for the first time, our environment starts to <unk>
And I'm going to show you just a <unk> insisting on the idea of getting the environment and push something.
Let's start with the detection.
The first project I wanted to share with you is actually one of the first projects of our lab.
This was four and a half years ago in Italy.
It was a summer with luck 2006.
It was the year in which Italy won the World Cup.
Maybe some of you remember it, they were playing Italy and France, and at the end, <unk> gave the <unk>
And anyway, I finally won Italy.
Now let's see what happened that day that day looking at activity in the network.
Here we see the city.
You see the <unk> in the middle and the <unk> River.
It's the morning, before the game.
The timeline.
So early early there are people around here and making <unk> <unk>
It starts <unk> silence.
<unk> in France.
<unk> people do a phone call and go to the bathroom.
Second time. End of time.
First time <unk> a second.
<unk> and at a moment, the <unk>
She earns Italy, yeah!
That night everyone was <unk> to the center.
There you see the great <unk>
The next day everyone went to the center of the <unk> and the prime minister then.
And then everybody <unk>
You see the picture of the place called <unk> <unk> where, since the <unk> <unk> people go to <unk> it's a great party, you can see the peak at the end of the day.
This is just an example of how you can measure the pulse of the city in a way that we wouldn't have been able to do a few years ago.
Another quick example of <unk> is not about people, but things that we use and we use.
Today, we know all about the shape of our objects.
This is a map that shows all the chips that make up a Mac, the way it <unk>
But we know very little about where things are.
So in this project, we developed a little bit of little tags to track the garbage through the system.
We started with a few volunteers who helped us in Seattle a few more than a year ago, to tag what they were <unk> different kinds of things, as you can see, things that are all <unk>
Then we put them a little chip, a <unk> <unk> and then we started <unk>
These are the <unk> results.
From <unk>
after a week.
With this information, we realized that there are many <unk> in the system.
We can do the same thing with much less energy.
These are data that didn't exist before.
There are complicated things happening and there's a lot of transportation <unk>
But the other thing we think is that if you look at every day that the cup that <unk> doesn't go out there is still somewhere on the planet.
That if the bottle of plastic that we put one day is still there.
If we show that to people, then we can promote some change of behavior.
That was the project.
My colleague at MIT, <unk> <unk> could tell us much more about detection and lots of other cool things that we can do with that, but I wanted to go to the second part we talked about at the beginning, which is to push over the environment.
And the first project is something we did a couple years ago in <unk>
It all began with a question of the mayor of the city, who came and told us that Spain and southern Europe have a beautiful tradition of water use in public spaces.
And the question was, how can technology technology, new technology, join that?
And one of the ideas that we developed at MIT, in a workshop, was, imagine that you have a <unk> and you <unk> valves of <unk> <unk> that open and <unk>
It's believed like a curtain <unk> with pixels of water.
If you fall the pixels on them, I'll show you patterns, show patterns, images texts.
And when you zoom in, the curtain will open up so that we could happen, as you see in the picture.
We presented this to the mayor <unk>
He liked it very much.
And they <unk> a commission to design the <unk>
We call it <unk> <unk>
The whole building is made of water.
There are no windows and no windows -- but when you come up to you it is open so you can happen.
The ceiling is also covered in water.
And if there's a little bit of wind, if you want to minimize the <unk> down the roof.
Or you can close the building and all the architecture disappears, like this case.
And those days will always be someone, in the winter, when you go down the roof, someone who was there and said, <unk> the <unk>
No, it's not <unk> but when it's low almost all the architecture goes away.
Here it is running.
You see the people who are <unk> by what's inside.
And here I'm myself trying not to <unk> the sensors that open the water.
I think I should tell you what happened one night when all the sensors stopped going to work.
That night it was actually even more fun.
All the kids in <unk> came to the building because the way to interact with a little bit.
It was no longer a building that opens up to let you happen, but a building that kept doing <unk> and holes, and you had to jump to not <unk>
<unk> noises) And for us that was really interesting because as architects, engineers, designers, we always think about how people give our designs.
But then reality is always unpredictable.
And that's the beauty of doing things to interact that people use.
This is a picture of the building with the physical pixels -- the pixels of water, and of projections on them.
And this is what led us to think about the next project I'm going to show you.
Imagine that those pixels could begin to fly.
Imagine that they could have small helicopters in the air, and every one had a small pixel that changes color as if it were a cloud that moves in space.
This is the video.
Imagine a helicopter, like the one we saw earlier, which moves with others in synchrony.
We could form this cloud,
A kind of flexible screen like this with a normal configuration in two dimensions.
Or in three dimensions, but in three dimensions, where what changes is light, not the pixel position.
You can play it with a different guy.
Imagine that the screen would appear in different scales and sizes, in different kinds of resolution.
And then all of that could be able to see a cloud of pixels in 3D, that you can get anywhere and <unk> and see from very different perspectives.
This is the true <unk> <unk> going down to form a <unk> like earlier.
When the light lights away, you see this. The same thing we saw before.
Imagine each of them controlled by one person.
We can have each pixel with a input that comes from people, the movement of people, etc., etc.
I want to show you something for the first time.
We've been working with <unk> <unk> <unk> of the best dancers of ballet dancers today, the star of the New York City and the <unk> <unk> to capture their motions in 3D and use it as entry for <unk>
Here we can see <unk> dancing.
On the left side, you see the <unk> capture in different <unk>
It's so much <unk> 3D <unk> in real time as a movement.
Can the whole movement.
You can go all the way.
And once we have the pixels we can play with them, with color and movement, with gravity and <unk>
We want to use this as a possible input to <unk>
I wanted to show you the last project we're working on.
It's something for the London Olympics.
It's called <unk>
And the idea is, imagine again, that we could engage people to do something and change our <unk> environment as a <unk> farm as a <unk> <unk> but with a cloud.
Imagine that we could make everybody <unk> a little bit for a <unk>
And I think what has happened in the last few years is that, in the last two decades, we went from the physical world to the digital world.
We've digitized everything like knowledge, and it's accessible to the Internet.
Today, for the first time -- and the Obama campaign is <unk> we can move from the digital world, the <unk> of networks, the physical world.
In our case, this may we want to use it to design and make a <unk>
That would mean something built in a city.
But tomorrow can be to address the challenges of today: think about climate change or CO2 emissions. How do we move from digital world to the physical world.
The idea is that we can get people to do this together, in a collective way.
The cloud is a cloud, again, made from pixels in the same way that the real cloud is a cloud of particles.
And those particles are water, whereas in our cloud are pixels.
It's a physical structure in London, but the pixels.
You can move inside, have different experiences.
You can see from the bottom, to be able to share the main moments of the 2012 Olympics.
So it's both a physical cloud of the sky as something you can go up, like a new <unk>
You can get out there.
As if it was a new digital <unk> at night, but the most important thing is that being a new experience for anybody to go to the top.
Thank you.
Would you like to be better than they are?
Suppose I told you that, with just a change in your genes, you could improve <unk> for more accurate and faster.
Or maybe they would like to be in better ways, to get more <unk>
Would you like to be more attractive and make sure <unk>
How about to live more with good health?
Or maybe those people who always wanted to be more creative.
What else is they <unk>
What would you like, if you could choose something?
<unk> from the Audience: <unk> <unk>
How much people do they do creativity?
Raise your hand. Let me see.
<unk> Probably the number of creative people present there.
That's very good.
How many <unk> <unk>
A few more.
And the physical state.
A little less.
How about <unk>
Oh, most people, that makes me feel very well as a doctor.
If you could have something of this the world would be very different.
It's just <unk>
Or maybe that possible?
Evolution has been a <unk> theme here at the TED conference but today I want to give you the look of a doctor on the subject.
The great <unk> of the 20th century, <unk> <unk> which is in addition to the <unk> Church called <unk> wrote an essay titled "Nothing in biology makes sense of <unk> light.
But if you really accept biological evolution consider this: it's just the past, or the future?
It's about the other or about us?
This is another look at the tree of life.
The human part of this branch, right at one end is, of course, the one that interests us.
<unk> from a common ancestor with modern chimpanzees about six or eight million years ago.
There have been maybe 20 -- 25 different species of <unk>
Some have gone and <unk>
We have been here about <unk> years.
It might seem like we're very far from other parts of this tree of life, but actually, in most of the basic machinery of our cells is more or less the same.
You realize that we can harness and control the machinery of a common bacteria to produce the protein of human insulin that is used to treat <unk>
This is not like human insulin -- but it's the same protein, chemically <unk> of the <unk>
And talking about bacteria -- you realize that we all carry on the most bacteria that the cells that we have on the rest of the body?
Maybe 10 times more.
I mean, think ... when Antonio <unk> told you about the <unk> think about <unk>
The gut is a beautifully <unk> environment for those bacteria.
It's hot, dark <unk> is very <unk>
And we're going to give you all the nutrients that they can want no effort in their part.
It's really like a rapid pathway for bacteria to the occasional <unk> of some rush to the output.
But so on, we are a wonderful environment for those bacteria in the same way that they are essential to our life.
They help digest <unk> nutrients and protect us from certain diseases.
But what about the future?
We're in a kind of evolutionary balance as a species?
Or destined to become something different, something that is perhaps better <unk>
In this vast symphony <unk> of the universe, life on Earth is like a brief <unk> the animal kingdom, as one single and only <unk> and human life, a small note of grace.
That was us.
And it was also the <unk> part of this talk, so I hope you've got it.
When I first <unk> I had my first class of biology.
I was fascinated by the elegance and the beauty of biology.
I fell in love with the power of evolution, and I realized something fundamental in most of the existence of life, in the <unk> organisms -- each cell can simply divide and all the genetic energy of that cell is broadcast to the two daughters of that cell.
But when organisms appear to <unk> things start to change.
It goes into sexual reproduction.
And a very important thing about the emergence of sexual reproduction that takes the genome, the rest of the body becomes <unk>
In fact, one might say that the <unk> of the body of the body gets into evolution at the same time of sexual reproduction.
I have to <unk> that when I was a college student, I thought, well, <unk> <unk> death by <unk> it seemed quite reasonable at that time, but with every year that was happening, I had more and more <unk>
I got to understand the feelings of George <unk> who still <unk> in Las Vegas in its 90 years.
And one night somebody hits her door to a hotel.
He opens the door.
In front of he finds a magnificent <unk> dancer, of clothes.
And he looks at it and he says, <unk> in search of a <unk> <unk>
"It says George, "I choose the <unk>
I realized, as a doctor, who was working for a different goal to the goal of <unk> not necessarily <unk> just different.
I was trying to preserve the body.
I wanted you to get healthy.
I wanted to recover the health in the disease.
I wanted to live more and more healthy.
Evolution is going to move the genome into the next <unk> adapt and <unk> generation after generation.
From an evolutionary point of view, you and I are like <unk> rockets and designed to send the genetic burden on the next level, and then let ourselves fall into the sea.
I think we all <unk> the feeling that expressed Woody Allen when he said, "I don't want to achieve immortality through my job.
I want to <unk> you don't know.
Evolution is not necessarily true for longevity.
It wouldn't necessarily be true to the biggest or the strongest or the faster, even the smarter.
Evolution helps the best <unk> creatures adapted to their environment.
That's the only trial for survival and success.
In the bottom of the ocean, the bacteria <unk> that can survive the heat of the <unk> that would be <unk> if there were fish there, fish <unk> to the empty, yet they've managed to do that a <unk> environment.
So what does this mean when we look at what's happening in evolution and if we look back to thinking about the place of humans in evolution and, in particular, if we look forward to the <unk> phase, I would say that there are many possibilities.
The first one is that we don't know.
We've reached kind of <unk>
And the underlying thinking underlying medicine, first of all, we've learned to preserve a lot of genes that otherwise would have been <unk> and <unk> from the population.
And secondly, as a species, we have <unk> our environment to be adapted to us as well as we adapt to it.
And by the way, <unk> <unk> and <unk> us so much that it is no longer possible to have the necessary necessary for the evolution of evolution.
A second possibility is that there's an evolution of the natural type, dictated by the forces of nature.
And the argument here is that the gears of evolution can slowly, but they're <unk>
And as soon as we <unk> when a species, distant planets are going to have the isolation and environmental changes that can produce natural evolution.
But there is a third possibility -- an <unk> and intriguing and frightening.
I call this <unk> the new evolution, which is not simply <unk> but <unk> and elected by us as individuals in the decisions that we <unk>
Now, how could this happen?
How could we get to do this?
We first consider the reality that many people today, in some cultures, are making decisions about their offspring.
In some cultures, they're choosing to have more males than women.
It's not necessarily a good thing for society, but it's what you pick up the individual and familiar level.
Think about that if you could be able to choose not just the sex of your <unk> but in your own body to make the genetic modifications to cure or prevent disease.
And if we could make genetic change to eliminate diabetes or Alzheimer's or reduce the risk of cancer or eliminate the <unk>
Don't want to make those changes on your <unk>
If we look at the future that kind of changes will be increasingly possible.
The Human Genome Project started in 1990 and sued 13.
<unk> <unk> million dollars.
By the year after we finished, in 2004, I could do the same work for 20 million dollars in three or four months.
Today, you can get a full sequence of the 3,000 million base pairs in the human genome at a cost near the 20,000 and a week.
Not a lot of the fact that the human genome is actually going to make the human genome for <unk> and getting more and more to all the scope of all.
They come up with those changes.
The same technology that has produced the human insulin in bacteria can make viruses that are not only going to protect them but are going to induce <unk> against other viruses.
<unk> or there is no experimental trial in the course of the <unk> <unk> in cells from a tobacco plant.
Can you imagine a good thing that comes out of the <unk>
That's actually today and the future is going to be increasingly possible.
Imagine then only two little <unk>
They can change the cells in their bodies, but if they could change the cells of their <unk>
And if you could change the sperm and the <unk> or change the <unk> <unk> and give your children a better chance of a healthier life, eliminate diabetes, eliminate the <unk> reduce the risk of cancer?
Who doesn't want more <unk>
And then that same <unk> technology that is that same engine of science that can produce the changes to prevent diseases that are going to allow us to allow us to adopt <unk> <unk> a better memory.
Why not have the ingenuity of one Ken <unk> especially if you could <unk> with the next generation of the machine <unk>
Why not have a <unk> muscle that allowed us to run faster and more <unk>
Why don't you live longer?
This is going to be <unk>
And when we are in conditions going to the next generation and we can adopt the attributes we wanted to have become the evolution of before in the <unk>
We're going to take a process that normally could lead 100,000 years and we can <unk> it to 1,000 years and maybe happen within the next hundred years.
These are elections.
We're going to use these options in a better society, more successful, more successful society.
Or, we're going to make different attributes that we want for some of us but not for the others?
We're going to build a society that is more boring and more robust, or more <unk> and more <unk>
This is the kind of question we're going to have to face.
And the deeper of all, we're going to be able to develop wisdom and inherit the wisdom necessary to make these <unk> decisions.
For good or for worse, and before you could take these choices to depend on us.
Thank you.
Imagine a big blast when you're at 900 feet high.
Imagine a plane full of smoke.
Imagine a motor doing <unk> <unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> sounds scary.
Well, I had a single seat that day. He was sitting in the <unk>
It was the only one I could talk to the flight.
So I immediately looked at it, and they said, "There's no problem. You probably slam some <unk>
The pilot had already <unk> the plane, and we weren't so far.
You could see Manhattan.
Two minutes later, three things happened at the same time.
The pilot <unk> the plane with the Hudson River.
Mostly that's not the road.
<unk> the engines.
Imagine being on an airplane and without <unk>
And then three words said three words.
The three <unk> words that I heard heard.
He said, <unk> for the <unk>
I didn't have to talk about the flight <unk>
I was able to see it in his eyes.
Was it terror. Life is <unk>
I want to share with you three things that I learned about myself that day.
I learned that everything changes in a second.
We have this list of things to do before you die, these things that we want to do in life, and I thought about all the people I wanted to come in, and I didn't, and I didn't, all the fences I wanted to <unk> all the experiences that I've wanted to have and never <unk>
As I thought about that further, I got a sentence, which is, <unk> wines <unk>
Because if the wine is ready and the person is there, I'll just show it up.
I don't want to do anything in life.
And that urgency, that's really changed my life.
The second thing that I learned that day -- and this is while <unk> the George <unk> Washington that wasn't a lot -- I thought about, wow, I really feel a great <unk>
I've lived a good life.
In my humanity and with my mistakes, I've tried to improve on everything I did.
But in my humanity I also give my ego.
And I'm sorry for the time that I was going to do things that didn't matter with people who do matter.
And I thought in my relationship with my wife, with my friends, with people.
And then as <unk> in that, I decided to remove the negative energy of my life.
It's not perfect, but it's much better.
In two years, I haven't had a fight with my wife.
It feels like <unk>
I'm not trying to have <unk> <unk> to be <unk>
The third thing I learned -- and this is how your mental clock goes <unk> <unk> 14, <unk>
You see the water <unk>
I'm saying, "Please <unk>
I don't want this to be broken in 20 pieces as you see in those <unk>
And as I <unk> I had the sense of, wow, death is not afraid.
It's almost like we've been <unk> for that all of our life.
But it was very sad.
I didn't want to <unk> I love my life.
And that sadness <unk> in a single thought, which is, I just wish one thing.
I wish I could see my children grow.
A month later, I was in a performance in my daughter -- first grade, not much artistic <unk> --   And I scream, <unk> as a little kid.
And to me, that was the whole reason for being the world.
At that point, I got to connect those two points, which the only matter that matters in my life is to be a great father.
For all, the only goal I have in life is to be a good father.
I gave myself a miracle, not to die that day.
And I gave myself another gift, which was the ability to look at the future and go back and live in another way.
You guys are flying today, the challenge to imagine that the same thing happens on your airplane -- and please make it not that -- but imagine, how do you <unk>
What are you <unk> you still expect to do because they think they're going to live <unk>
How do your relationships change and the negative energy in them?
And most importantly, they're the best parents who are the best parents who are <unk>
Thank you.
I've clearly been <unk> in life with many <unk> projects.
But the most great thing I worked was for this guy.
The guy is called <unk>
<unk> was one of the most important <unk> in the '80s.
One day he got to his house after a day and said, "Dad, I feel a <unk> in the <unk>
And that was the beginning of ALS.
<unk> has complete <unk>
You can just use your eyes.
Her work influenced me.
I have a design firm and animation, and obviously, graffiti is something intricate that we admire and <unk> in the world of art.
So we decided we were going to send them to <unk> <unk> and their cause.
So I went and met with his brother and father and said, "We're going to give you this money.
What are you going to do with <unk>
And his brother said, "I just want to be able to talk about Tony again.
I just want to be able to communicate with him and that he's able to communicate with me."
And I said, "A second, is not that <unk> seen Stephen <unk> not that all people with paralysis can communicate with those <unk>
And he said, "No, unless you be an important one, and you have a very good insurance you can't actually do it.
These devices are not affordable for people."
And I said, "Well, how do they communicate then?"
Does anybody see the movie "The <unk> and the <unk>
They communicate that way, they communicate with your finger.
I said, "That's <unk> How can it be?"
So I presented to me with the only desire to deliver a check, and instead of that signed a check that I had no idea how he was going to <unk>
I was <unk> with his brother and his father there at the very moment, "All right, this is the <unk> Tony is going to speak, we're going to build a machine, and we're going to find a way to make her art again.
Because it's ridiculous that somebody who has so much inside your inside cannot <unk>
So I talked about a couple months later.
I met these guys called <unk> <unk> Research <unk> that have a technology that allows them to project a light on any surface and then, with a laser pointer that is about that and register negative space.
So they're going around doing art facilities like this.
All the things that they <unk> they say, are part of a life cycle.
They first start with sex organs then with the bad words, then with the Bush attacks, and at the end, people start to do art.
But there was always a life cycle in <unk>
And so the journey started.
And about two years later, about a year later, after a lot of organization and a lot of organization and so much to move things back to another, we had achieved a couple of things.
One is, we touch the gates of insurance companies and get a machine so that you could imagine it could <unk> a machine like Stephen <unk>
Which was great.
And seriously, is the most <unk> I call it <unk> because when I talk to the guy you get an email from him, and you say, "Don't <unk> This guy's <unk>
The other thing we did was to bring seven programmers from all over the world <unk> from every corner of the <unk> to our house.
My wife, the kids and I, we moved to the garage and these hackers and programmers and programmers and <unk> they took control of the house.
Many of our friends thought that we would do something totally stupid and that when they <unk> it would have taken out the walls of the walls and in their place there would be <unk>
But for two weeks, I was <unk> we went to <unk> <unk> my son was part of my dog, and we created this.
It's called <unk>
These are a couple of <unk> <unk> that we bought in the Atlantic <unk> Beach, some copper wire and <unk> <unk> and Radio <unk>
We take a <unk> camera, we put it together on an LED light, and now there's a device that is free -- and you build yourself, we published the code by <unk> the software is low in free.
And we created a device that has no limitation at all.
There's no insurance company to say "No."
There's no hospital who can say "No."
Any person with paralysis today has access to drawing and communicate using just their eyes.
Thank you.
Thank you very much for you.
So at the end of the two weeks, we went back to the <unk> room.
I love this picture because this is the <unk> room, and that's his room.
There was all this <unk> and <unk> during the great opening.
And after a year of planning, two weeks of training, I was teaching them intense from all night, Tony came back to draw for the first time in seven years.
And this is a wonderful picture because this is the support system of his life and is looking through the support system.
I ran the bed so I could see.
And we put a projector on a wall of the parking lot.
And he came back for the first time in front of his family and friends and you can imagine what it was in the parking lot.
The funny thing was we had to take on the parking lot so that we felt like we were <unk> the graffiti as well.
And at the end of this, he sent us an email and this was what was like, "This was the first time to draw in seven years.
I felt like I had been underwater and someone finally came to <unk> and let me get me out there so that I could <unk>
It's not <unk>
In a way, that's our <unk>
That's what keeps us in movement, <unk>
And we have a long way to go through this.
It's a cool device but it's the equivalent of a <unk> <unk>
Someone with this artistic potential deserve a lot more.
So we're trying to figure out how to <unk> and make it faster and robust.
Since then we have had all kinds of recognition.
We've gained many awards.
Remember, it's <unk> none of us are making money with this.
Everything comes out of our own pockets.
<unk> were like, "Oh, this is <unk>
Armstrong <unk> something about us, and then, in December, Time magazine recognized us as one of the 50 best inventions of 2010, and it was really cool.
The best thing about this -- and this is what ends up from closing the <unk> is that in April of this year in the <unk> <unk> in the middle of Los Angeles is going to be an exhibition called <unk> in <unk>
And <unk> in the <unk> is going to have the best <unk> of the urban art, <unk> <unk> <unk> all of them will be there.
<unk> is going to be on the show which is pretty awesome.
So, basically, this is my idea: if you look at something that is not possible, do it possible.
None of what there is in this room -- it was possible -- the stage, the <unk> the microphone, the <unk> nothing was possible at a certain point.
Make it <unk> anything in this room.
I'm not a programmer, I never did anything with <unk> <unk> technology, I just recognized something and <unk> me with wonderful people in order to make it happen.
And these are the questions I want you all to do every day when we find ourselves with something that we feel to do, and if it's not now, <unk> And if I'm not me, <unk>
Thank you guys.
I've spent the last few years <unk> in very difficult situations and at the same time a very dangerous time.
I went to the hard <unk>
I worked in a dangerous <unk>
<unk> in <unk> and dangerous <unk>
And I spent 30 days by eating only this -- it really fun at the beginning, something difficult in the middle, very dangerous at the end.
In fact, in much of my career, I've been <unk> in horrible situations with the only goal to treat.
So when I knew that I would come here to do a TEDTalk on the world of brands and <unk> I wanted to do something a little different.
So some of you may have heard of, or not a couple of weeks ago, I took a <unk> <unk>
I sent some messages on Facebook, some on Twitter, offered to sale the rights of the name of my TEDTalk <unk>
What there was was this: <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> my TEDTalk that you have no idea what it is and the content could be <unk> in the face, especially if I put it in ridiculous to you or your company to do it.
But he said this, it's a very good <unk>
You know how many people look at these <unk>
<unk>
It's a degree in progress, by the way.
So even with that <unk> I knew somebody was going to buy the rights of the name.
If you had asked me a year ago, he wouldn't have been able to do it for certain.
But in the new film that I'm working, we look at the world of the marketing <unk>
And as I said earlier, I've gotten in some horrible situations in the last few years, but nothing could tell me anything that was so dangerous or so dangerous as you get into the rooms with these guys.
You see, I had this idea for a movie.
Morgan <unk> I want to make a film that tried to do the <unk> of products, marketing and advertising, and that the whole film will be <unk> with <unk> of marketing and marketing and advertising.
The movie is going to call "The biggest <unk>
What happens in "The biggest <unk> film is that all up to the bottom, first at the end, it has a brand, and all the time; from the <unk> that appears before the title of the title, the <unk>
Now this brand, <unk> <unk> <unk>
These people <unk> the film to <unk> forever.
And so the film explores all of this idea. <unk> <unk> is <unk> Is what?
I'm a <unk> <unk>
He was <unk> forever."
But we're not just going to have the sponsors of the X brand at the title but we're going to make sure that we would have all the categories that we could in the film.
Maybe a shoe and a shoe is going to be the most great shoe you've ever met.
The most great car that you've driven in the biggest <unk> movie ever <unk> the best <unk> than you have <unk> from "The biggest <unk>
<unk> <unk> The idea is then to show the brands as part of life, to make them <unk> the <unk> <unk> to make it <unk> MS: And we actually show the whole process of how it works.
The complete goal of the film is transparency.
You're going to see the whole process in this film.
That's the complete idea, all the shot of the shot to end.
And I would love to help you help make it happen.
Robert <unk> You know, it's funny because it's funny because it's the first time I hear that -- it's the most respected for the audience.
<unk> However, I don't know how <unk> is going to be the people to that.
<unk> You have a <unk> I don't know if you <unk> it's very <unk> but you know how it goes to <unk> <unk>
MS: One and a half <unk> <unk> Very <unk> John <unk> I think it's going to be a difficult meeting to them, but certainly is going to be worth to convince a couple of big <unk>
<unk> Who knows, maybe for the moment that the movie was going to look at us as a lot of <unk> <unk>
MS: What do you think is going to be the answer?
Stuart <unk> Most of the answers will be "No."
MS: But being hard to <unk> for the film or for me.
JK: So both things.
MS: That means you're not very optimistic.
So I <unk> I need help.
MK: I can help.
MS: All right. <unk> Awesome.
MK: We need to think about what brands.
MS: Yeah. <unk> That's the <unk> When you look at the people you have to <unk>
MK: We have some places where we go, <unk> <unk> <unk>
MS: I thought that <unk> <unk> meant we have a conversation out of microphone.
<unk> the camera means "We don't want to know about your <unk>
MS: And so it was, one by one, all these companies suddenly disappeared.
None of them wanted to have anything to do with this film.
I was shocked.
They didn't want to know about this project.
And I was very <unk> I thought that the concept of advertising, was to introduce the product to as many people as possible, to make as many people looked at it as possible.
Especially in the world today this intersection of new media and old media and the landscape of the separate media scenario is not the idea to have that new vehicle that is worth the message to <unk>
No, that was what I thought.
But the problem was, you see, that my idea had a <unk> error and that mistake was this.
Actually, no, there was no mistake.
There was no mistake at all.
This would have been right.
But the problem was what this image.
See, when you search for images of <unk> on Google <unk>   This is one of the first images that were <unk>
I like your <unk> Sergey <unk> No.
This was the problem: the <unk> of simulation or <unk> <unk> or <unk> easily <unk> which is characterized by the visibility or access of information, especially in <unk> practices.
You see, we heard a lot about transparency in these days.
Our politicians the <unk> President <unk> even <unk> <unk>
But all of a sudden when it comes to make it really change something changes.
But why? Well, transparency gives <unk> --  -- like that weird bear that is still <unk>
It's <unk>   Like this rare rural <unk>
And it's also very risky.
What else is it <unk>
<unk> a whole bowl of <unk> <unk>
That's very risky.
When I started talking to the companies and telling them that we wanted to tell this story and they said, "No, we want to <unk> <unk> history.
We want you to make a story, but that <unk> <unk> story."
See, when I was a kid, and my father would lie to me in some lie -- and there he was looking at me looking like he used to say, "Son, there are three sides in the story.
It's your story, it's my story, and it's the story <unk>
As you can see, in this film, we wanted to tell the real story.
But with only one company, a agency wanting to help me -- and that just because I knew John Bond and Richard <unk> of many years -- I realized I would have to go to my own, I would have to take off the middle and go to the companies I have to take off my team.
So what I started to think about suddenly -- and what I started to give me <unk> is that when you start talking with companies the idea of understanding your brand is a universal problem.
MS: I've got friends that do big, huge, giant films, and others who make small, independent films, like mine.
And my friends who make Hollywood films -- they say the reason why their films are so successful is because the brands are associated with the brands that they have.
And then my friends who make independent films say, "Well, how are we supposed to compete with these big, <unk> <unk>
And the movie is called "The biggest <unk>
How are we going to find specifically <unk> in the movie?
Every time I go out, every time I open my <unk> you'll see the <unk> <unk>
At any time during an interview with somebody I can say, "Are you cool for this <unk>
You're ready? You look a little nervous.
I want to help you <unk>
Maybe you should get a little bit of this before the <unk>
And there I offer one of these <unk> <unk>
Both <unk> <unk> like <unk> of the <unk> are going to have their opportunity.
We're going to have so much for man as for <unk> <unk> to <unk> in bar, like it.
That's the big picture.
Now I can answer your questions and give you a look at <unk>
Karen Frank: Are we a little <unk>
They <unk> the smallest kind of movies that we <unk> are rather a <unk>
So we don't have the budget that other brands.
So do things like that, you know, you will remind people is the reason that we care about.
MS: What words would they use to describe <unk>
<unk> is in white.
<unk> That's a big question.
Volunteer: <unk>
MS: Technology is not the way you want to describe something that you can put in the <unk>
Man: We talk about something <unk> <unk>
I think <unk> is a great word that really puts this category on positive versus <unk> smell and <unk>
It keeps you right.
How do we keep ourselves fresh time? You better <unk> more <unk> three times a <unk>
Things like those that <unk> the benefits.
MS: And that's a <unk> company.
What about me? What about a common?
I need to talk to the man from the street, to people like me, to the common <unk>
They have to tell me from my brand.
MS: How do you define your <unk>
Man: <unk> my <unk>
I don't know.
I like good <unk>
Woman: revive the '80s, <unk> <unk> unless it is <unk>
MS: All right, what is the brand <unk>
<unk> Something unique. <unk> Man: I guess the kind of gender, the style I have to be like a <unk> <unk>
I like a lot of the dark colors, a lot of gray colors and things like that.
Usually I wear <unk> like <unk> or I like the <unk>
Woman: If Dan was a brand could be a <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
Man 2: The brand I am, I would call it <unk> <unk>
Woman 2: <unk> part of <unk> in part <unk> <unk> I don't know.
Man 3: I'm the kind of pets.
<unk> toys for pets in the country and in the world.
So I guess that's my brand.
In my little sector, that's my brand.
Man 4: My brand is FedEx because he <unk> the <unk>
Man 5: <unk> <unk> failed.
Is that something?
<unk> I'm a <unk>
<unk> I'm <unk>
MS: Well, we can't all be a brand Tom, but I often lie at the intersection of <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk>
I realized I needed an expert.
I needed somebody who could go into my head, someone who could help me understand what they call the <unk> <unk>
And I found a company called <unk> <unk> in Pittsburgh.
They helped companies like <unk> <unk> <unk> to discover that <unk> personality.
If they were able to do it for them, they could surely do it for me.
<unk> <unk> the pictures, right?
MS: Yes. The first photo is a familiar photograph.
A: Tell me a little bit about how you relate to your thoughts and feelings that way.
MS: These people shape my way to see the world.
A: Tell me about that world.
MS: That world -- I think your world is the world that we <unk> as the people around you, your friends, your family, the way you live your life, the work you do.
All of those things come back and start in a place and in my case they come back and start in my family, in West Virginia.
A: What's the next one you want to talk about.
MS: The next is "This was the best day in my life."
A: How does this relate to your thoughts and feelings and your way to be?
MS: That's how I want to be me.
I like the different things.
I like things funny -- I like weird stuff.
A: Tell me about <unk> what do we do for that?
What's the <unk> What phase of <unk> are you right now?
Why is it important to <unk> What is the <unk>
Tell me a little bit about that.
It's a little bit more than you, which you are.
What other <unk> have you <unk>
It doesn't have to be frightened. What kind of Russian rollercoaster are you?
MS: <unk> <unk> Thank you.) No, thank you.
A: Thank you for your patience. <unk> Great <unk> Yes. <unk> Thank you very much.) All right.
MS: Yeah, I don't know what's going to get out of this.
There was a lot of madness to all this.
<unk> <unk> The first thing I saw was this idea that there are two different sides -- but <unk> in your personality of <unk> the brand Morgan <unk> is a <unk> <unk>
They were very well <unk> together.
And I think there's almost a paradox on them.
And I think that some companies just <unk> in one of their strong points or the other instead of focusing on both.
A lot of companies tend to be -- and it's nature -- to avoid the things that are not <unk> they avoid fear, those elements, and you are actually <unk> and you get something positive for you, and it's nice to see that.
What other brands are you?
The first here is the classic Apple.
And you can also see here to <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk>
There are now playful marks and <unk> those things that have gone and come out, but a <unk> brand is pretty powerful.
MS: <unk> <unk> What's your <unk>
If somebody asks you to raise your brand, your <unk> <unk> what would that be?
You're a <unk> attribute that you are someone who makes blood <unk>
Or are you more <unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk> <unk>
<unk> attributes are like being playful to be playful as <unk> contemporary <unk> <unk> or bold as <unk> <unk> <unk> or <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> or mystical like <unk>
Or you're more <unk> <unk>
You're conscious, sophisticated <unk>
You're <unk> traditional <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
You're <unk> stable, familiar, <unk> safe, sacred, <unk> or wise as the Dalai Lama or <unk>
Over the course of this film we had over 500 companies, <unk> and <unk> who said, <unk> they didn't want to be part of this project.
They didn't want to have anything to do with this movie, mainly because they wouldn't have control, they would have no control over the final product.
We were allowed to tell the story of the <unk> and we got to tell the story in this film of how you now use MRI to identify the centers of desire in the brain so much for film marketing for movies.
We went to St. Paulo where they have <unk> open-air <unk>
In the entire city over the last five years, there's no <unk> there's no <unk> nothing.
And we went to school districts where companies are getting into schools with problems in the U.S.
The amazing thing to me is that the projects I have had the biggest answer or that I've been more successful is those where I've interacted with things directly.
And that's what these brands.
<unk> the <unk> took away their agencies, and they said maybe these agencies don't have my best interest in mind.
I'm going to try and get directly to the artist.
I'm going to work with him to create something different, something that is going to make people think that is going to challenge the way we look at the world.
And how has he gone? <unk>
Well, since the movie was released in the <unk> <unk> let's take a look.
According to <unk> the movie was released in January, and since then -- and this is not <unk> we've had 900 million prints on the media for this film.
This is just a period of two weeks and a half.
That's just in <unk> and press, and TV.
The movie is still not <unk>
It's not online. It's not in <unk>
It's not even presented in other countries yet.
Ultimately, this film has already begun to make momentum.
And it's not bad, because almost all the agencies that we talk about is not being a part.
I've always believed that if you take risks, if you take risks, that in those risks there are opportunities.
I think when you get out to the people that's pushing it to failure.
I think that when you train your employees at the risk of being preparing their entire company to reward them.
I feel that what needs to happen to move forward is that we have to encourage people to <unk>
We have to encourage people to encourage people who are not afraid of the opportunities they can <unk>
Ultimately, we have to give it to the fear.
We have to put that bear in a cage.
<unk> fear <unk> <unk>
From a <unk> at the time, we have to embrace the risk.
And ultimately, we have to hold transparency.
And more than ever a bit of honesty is going to go a long way.
And I said this, with honesty and transparency, my whole talk -- the <unk> has been introduced by my good friends of <unk> who for <unk> bought the rights of the name in <unk>
<unk> <unk> big data in large opportunities for companies around the world.
<unk> presents <unk> <unk>
Thank you very much people.
June Cohen: So I had June of the name of transparency, which happened exactly with those <unk>
MS: It's a fantastic question.
In my pocket I have a check on the name of the TED matrix, the <unk> Foundation, a check for <unk> to be applied to my attendance for TED <unk>
The idea behind the <unk> computer is actually very simple.
We don't want Iran to get the nuclear bomb.
Their biggest asset to develop nuclear weapons is the <unk> plant.
The gray boxes that you see are control systems in real time.
If we managed to compromise these systems that control speeds and <unk> we can cause a lot of problems with <unk>
The gray boxes don't use <unk> software -- are from a completely different technology.
But if we managed to put an effective virus from Windows on a laptop using an engineer to set up this gray box, then we're ready.
This is the <unk>
We started with a <unk> Windows.
The <unk> enter the gray box damages the <unk> and the Iranian nuclear program is <unk> <unk> mission.
It's easy, <unk>
I want to tell you how we discovered this.
When we started to research on <unk> six months ago, the purpose was completely unknown.
The only thing that you knew is that it's very, very complex in the <unk> the <unk> used multiple <unk> <unk>
It seemed like to do something with these <unk> these <unk> control systems.
That struck us the attention, and we started an experiment where we had our environment with <unk> and we saw what happened to this.
So they spent very strange things.
<unk> <unk> like a lab rat that didn't like our <unk> the wave, but I didn't want to eat.
I didn't make sense for me.
And after experimenting with different flavors of cheese, I realized, and I thought, "This is a <unk> attack.
It's completely <unk>
The <unk> is looking for active in the gray box if you find a specific configuration, and even if the program is trying to infect is actually working on that place: there.
If not, <unk> does nothing.
So that rang my attention, and we started working on this almost 24 hours a day, because <unk> "We don't know what the <unk> is.
Could we say, for example, a power plant plant or a chemical plant in Germany.
Better than <unk> the goal soon.
And so we pulled out and <unk> the seizure code, and we found that I was <unk> in two <unk> bombs.
We also saw that they were very professionally armed people who obviously had all the internal information.
They <unk> all the points that we attack.
You probably even know how much the operator.
So you know everything.
And if you've heard that <unk> <unk> is complex, and high tech, let me tell you the burden is very complex.
It's very above everything we've seen before.
Here you see a sample of this code of attack.
We're talking about 15 lines of code.
It looks like the old language <unk>
I want to tell you how we were able to find sense to this code.
What we were looking at was calls into functions of the system, because we know what they do.
We were looking for <unk> and data structures and we tried to <unk> them with the real world, with potential real world.
We need theories about recipients that we can pass or <unk>
To get to theories about goals, we remember that it's definitely a violent <unk> it must be a <unk> <unk> and it's probably located in Iran, because it's where most of the infections has been <unk>
There are no thousand targets in that area.
It basically boils down to the nuclear power plant and the <unk> plant.
So I told my <unk> <unk> a list of all experts in <unk> and power plants between our <unk>
I called them and join them in an effort for <unk> their experience with what we find in code and data.
And it worked pretty well.
So we could associate the little digital <unk> with control of the <unk>
rotor is that mobile part of the <unk> that black object you see.
If you run the speed of this <unk> they certainly can <unk> and even make the <unk> <unk>
What we also saw is that the goal of the attack was to make it slow and <unk> in an obvious way to go back to the nest engineer so that they couldn't solve this very quickly.
We're trying to figure out the big digital <unk> looking very closely at the data and their structures.
So for example, the number <unk> <unk> <unk> in that code, you can't <unk>
I started looking at scientific literature about how these <unk> are built in <unk> and found that they're <unk> in what's called a <unk> and every waterfall has <unk> <unk>
That made sense, there was a coincidence.
And it got better yet.
These <unk> in Iran are <unk> in 15 pieces called stages.
And guess what we found in the code of <unk>
It's almost <unk> structure.
So again, that was a good coincidence.
This gave us a lot of confidence in understanding what we had between hands.
So there was no <unk> it wasn't like this.
The results have been due to a number of hard work.
<unk> <unk> dead ends.
Even so, we found that both digital <unk> would say to one and same goal, but from different perspectives.
The small little <unk> is taking a <unk> and making these <unk> <unk> and <unk> and <unk> <unk> communicate with six <unk> and manipulating it.
In <unk> we're very confident that we've determined what is the <unk>
It's <unk> and it's just <unk>
We should not worry about that other targets are <unk> by <unk>
So here I show you some very interesting things that we just saw, I really <unk>
There's the gray box and the top you see the <unk>
What this thing is doing is <unk> the input input values for example, of sensors and the vibration sensors and provide <unk> <unk> which is still running during the attack, with false data <unk>
And believe it or not, this false entry data is <unk> by <unk>
It's like in Hollywood movies where, during the <unk> the security camera is fed by video <unk>
It's great <unk>
The idea here is obviously not just <unk> the operators in the <unk>
It's really much more dangerous and <unk>
The idea is <unk> a digital security system.
We need digital security systems where a human operator could not act fast.
For example, in a energy plant, when the big steam turbine is <unk> you have to open from escape <unk>
Obviously, this can't do it a human operator, right?
That's where we need digital security systems.
And when they're <unk> then you can spend bad things.
The plant can exploit.
And not the <unk> and the security system <unk>
That scares me.
But it can be worse.
What I'm going to say is very important.
Think about this. This attack is <unk>
It has nothing to see, specifically with <unk> with <unk>
It could work also, for example, in a power plant, or in a factory factory.
It's <unk>
And you don't have <unk> <unk> to disseminate this burden with a <unk> key, like we saw in the case of <unk>
You can also use conventional technology to <unk>
It would be as much as possible.
And if you made that, with what we <unk> is with a <unk> of mass destruction.
That's the consequence we have to face.
Unfortunately, the largest number of targets for such attacks is not in the Middle East.
It's in the United States and in Japan.
All the green areas are a large number of goals.
We need to face the implications, and we better start preparing now.
Thank you.
Chris Anderson: I've got a question.
<unk> has become public in many sides that people assume that <unk> is the primary entity behind this.
What's your <unk>
Ralph <unk> Okay, you really want to listen to this?
Yeah. <unk>
My view is that the <unk> is involved, but the engine is not <unk>
The engine behind this is the <unk> <unk>
There's one alone, and that's the United States, fortunately, <unk>
Because, otherwise our problems would be even older.
CA: Thank you for <unk> Thank you, <unk>
I want you to imagine a robot that you can carry on and that give you <unk> abilities or other than making users of wheels get up and go back to walk.
In <unk> <unk> we call these robots, <unk>
They're not different from something that you put in the morning, give you a great force -- which is also increasing its speed, and helps it for example, to handle the balance.
It's actually the true integration of man and the machine.
But not only that -- it can integrate it and connect with the universe and with other <unk> <unk>
This is not a <unk> idea.
In order to show you now what we're working on with, we started talking about the American soldier who, on average, has to take on their back of a <unk> charge of a 45 pounds, and it's <unk> to take even more team.
Obviously, this leads to some important complications -- injuries in the back, at 30 percent of the soldiers -- with chronic damage to their back.
We decided to look at this challenge and create a exoskeleton that could help handle the issue.
Let me introduce you to the <unk> or <unk> <unk> Human Human Human <unk>
Soldier: With the exoskeleton <unk> I can give it 90 kilos for variables for many hours.
Their flexible design, it allows you to put in <unk> <unk> and running <unk>
<unk> what I want to do, or where I want to go, and then raise my strength and my resistance.
<unk> <unk> We're ready, with our industrial partner to produce this device, this new <unk> this year.
I mean, it's a reality.
Let's go back to the users of the wheels, so I feel particularly passionate about.
There are 68 million people in the <unk> in the whole world.
Like one percent of the total population.
And this is a really conservative.
We talk about something that happens very often, young people with damage to the column that when they start their life -- to 20, 30 or 40 years -- collide against a wall and the wheelchair turns out to be their only option.
We also talk about the population that are twice as quickly.
Their only option, many times -- by a brain injury, or some other complication -- is the <unk>
And this has been that for the last 500 years, from its successful <unk> as I have to recognize.
So we decided to start by writing a new chapter about mobility.
Let me introduce you to the <unk> which is using Amanda <unk> who was 19 years ago had an injury in the <unk> column and as a result could not go back for 19 years, so far.
Amanda <unk> Thank you.
EB: Amanda is using our <unk> that <unk>
It has sensors -- it has a few.
It's completely not <unk> in crutches that send signals to the computer on board, here on my back.
There are also some batteries that give power to the engines in the <unk> and at the knees, and they do it with this soft and very natural.
AB: I was 24 years old at the top of my life when, for a stranger in the air, skiing up the bottom was <unk>
In a fraction of a second, I lost all feeling and all movement from <unk> down.
Little time later, a doctor entered my room in the hospital, and he said, "You will never come to <unk>
That happened 19 years ago.
So I stole stole to the last hint of hope of my being.
<unk> technology since then, has allowed me to learn to <unk> it costs down on <unk> climbing rocks and even riding on a bicycle hand.
But they haven't invented anything that allowed me to walk, so far.
Thank you.
EB: As you can see, we have the technology, we have the platforms to sit and talk to you.
It's in our hands, and we have the whole potential here to change life for future generations -- not just of soldiers, but by Amanda, and all the users of the wheels, to all.
AB: Thank you.
I just returned from a community that has the secret of human survival.
It's a place where women have <unk> they practice sex to say hello, and play is the order of the day -- where fun is serious.
And no, it's not the <unk> Man festival or San Francisco.
Ladies and gentlemen, meet your cousins.
This is the world of the wild bonobos of the <unk>
The bonobos are along with chimpanzees, their closest relatives.
That means that we all share a common ancestor, an evolutionary grandmother, who lived about six million years ago.
Now chimpanzees are known for their <unk>
But unfortunately, we've done too much emphasis on this aspect in our narratives of human evolution.
But the bonobos show us the other side of the currency.
Whereas the chimps are dominated by large, <unk> society is in charge of females with power.
These guys have created something special because this leads to a very tolerant society where lethal violence is still not <unk>
But unfortunately, the bonobos are the least <unk> of the great apes.
They live in the depths of the rainforest <unk> and it's been very difficult to <unk>
Congo is a <unk> a land of extraordinary biodiversity and beauty, but also the heart of the <unk> <unk> scenario stage of a violent conflict that has been lasting for decades, and caused nearly as many deaths as the First World War.
No wonder that this destruction is also putting in danger of the Bonobo.
<unk> meat and deforestation trade, they can't fill in a stadium with the bonobos that are left in the world -- and honestly, we are not sure about it.
However, on this land of violence and chaos, you can hear laughter hidden by the trees.
Who are these <unk>
We know them as apes <unk> love, not <unk> because they have <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> to manage conflict and solve social problems.
I'm not saying that this is the solution to all of the problems of humanity because the life of Bonobos is more than <unk> <unk>
<unk> like humans, they love playing throughout their entire life.
Play is not just a <unk> game.
For us and the game is critical to establish links and encourage <unk>
We learn to <unk> and learn the rules of the game.
<unk> increases creativity and resilience and has to do with the generation of <unk> diversity of interactions, diversity of the connections of connections.
And when you look at the Bonobo <unk> it sees the roots -- same as the laughter, the dance and the human <unk>
The game is the glue that comes together.
I don't know how you play you, but I want to show you a couple of unique videos that are consistent from the wild.
First, it's a <unk> <unk> game, and I don't mention football game.
Here we have a female and a young male in the middle of a <unk>
Look at what's doing it.
It could be the evolutionary origin of the phrase, "You have <unk> <unk>
I just think that in this case he love, right?
Yeah.
So sexual game is common both in Bonobos as well as humans.
And this video is really interesting because this video is really interesting because it shows the invention of bringing unusual elements into play -- like <unk> and also how play requires trust and <unk> <unk> and at the same time is the most fun.
But the game is <unk>
The game is <unk> it can adopt many ways, some of which are more <unk> <unk> <unk> perhaps the place where the wonder.
And I want you to <unk> this is <unk> a young female who's playing with a <unk> water.
I think that we sometimes play alone, and we explore the boundaries of our inner worlds and outside.
And it's that playful curiosity that drives us to explore, interact. And then the unexpected connections that we form are the real <unk> of creativity.
These are just little samples of understanding that Bonobos give us from our past and present.
But they also have a secret to our future, a future where we have to adapt to a world increasingly difficult to greater creativity and greater cooperation.
The secret is that play is the key to these capabilities.
In other words, the game is our <unk> <unk>
To adapt to a world that changes we need to play.
But let's take it back to our maximum <unk>
The game is not <unk>
The game is essential.
For bonobos and humans alike, it's not just cruel and <unk>
When it seems to be the least appropriate to play, you can be the most urgent time.
So fellow primates, let's accept this gift of evolution and play together while <unk> creativity and friendship and wonder.
Thank you.
In New York I'm responsible for a nonprofit organization called Robin <unk>
When I'm not fighting poverty, <unk> fires as a captain of captain in a <unk> body.
And in our city, where volunteers are leading to a highly skilled staff one has to get to the fire site very soon to get into action.
I remember my first fire.
I was the second volunteer on the site, so I had a pretty high probability of going.
But there was still a career on the other volunteers to get the captain to the captain to figure out what our task was.
When I found <unk> I was <unk> in a conversation with the owner that certainly went through one of the worst days of his life.
We were in full night, she was standing outside in the rain, under a <unk> in his pajamas and <unk> while his house was on fire.
The other volunteer that I had just got before me, <unk> <unk> <unk>  came first to Captain and he asked him to go back and would save the dog's dog's dog.
<unk> I was <unk> <unk>
There I was a lawyer or a <unk> of money that, in the rest of his life, I would have to tell the people that I entered a <unk> building to save a living alive because I won for five seconds.
Well, I was the next one.
The captain made me a <unk>
He said, <unk> I need to get to the house.
I need to <unk> <unk> the fire, and let me bring this woman a couple of shoes."
I promise you.
It wasn't exactly what I expected but <unk> I went up the stairs, at the end of the hall, country to the <unk> firemen that at the height of the fire and he entered the main room for a pair of shoes.
I know what you're thinking, but I'm not a hero.
I took my burden on the staircase where I met my <unk> and the precious dog on the front door.
<unk> from house house treasures like waiting, her trove got much more attention than mine.
A few weeks later the department received a letter from the owner of <unk> <unk> by the brave effort he demonstrated to save her home.
The kindness that she looked at about what else was that somebody had even had a pair of shoes.
Both in my calling in Robin <unk> like my calling as volunteer <unk> I am witness to the acts of generosity and kindness on a <unk> scale, but also from <unk> and courage to the individual level.
And you know what I've learned?
Everything has its importance.
So when I look at this room to people who have achieved, or are there by achieving remarkable levels of success I'd like to remind you -- not wait.
Don't wait for winning the first million to make a difference in somebody's life.
If you have something for giving, <unk> now.
They put food in a <unk> <unk> a neighborhood park.
You've got to be mentors.
Not every day we're going to have the opportunity to save somebody's life, but each day we're going to be able to influence somebody's life.
So you enter the <unk> <unk> the shoes.
Thank you.
Bruno Giussani: Mark, you come back.
Mark <unk> Thank you.
This may seem strange, but I'm a big fan of the concrete block.
The first concrete blocks was built in <unk> with a very simple idea cement modules from a fixed measure that fits each other.
Very quickly, these became the most used unit in the world.
They have allowed us to build things bigger than us, as buildings or bridges, a brick at once.
Essentially, these blocks have become the pillars of our time.
Almost a hundred years later, in 1947, to <unk> came up with this.
He called him brick <unk>
And in a few years, the bricks of <unk> came to every home.
It's estimated that they've been over 400 billion or 75 bricks per person on the planet.
You don't have to be an engineer to build <unk> buildings, or buildings or homes.
<unk> made it accessible.
<unk> simply adopted the concrete block, the favorite in the world, and it turned it into a fundamental piece of our imagination.
Meanwhile, exactly that same year, in the Bell labs, the next revolution was about to <unk> the new building block.
The transistor was a little plastic unit that would take us from a world of aesthetic <unk> stacked about each other to a world where everything was interactive.
Like the concrete, the transistor allows the transistor to create much larger and more complex, a brick at once.
But there's a <unk> difference. The transistor was just to experts.
I don't personally appreciate it that the building blocks of our time are being reserved for experts, so I decided to change it.
Eight years ago, when I was at the Media Lab, I began to explore the idea of bringing the power of engineers into the hands of artists and designers.
A few years ago I began to develop <unk>
I'm going to show you how they work.
<unk> are electronic modules each with a specific function.
They're <unk> to be light, sound, motors and sensors.
And the best thing about all is that they join using magnets.
So you can't put it in a wrong way.
<unk> have one code of color.
The green is <unk> the <unk> the <unk> the pink is the <unk> and the orange color is the wire.
So you just have to assemble a blue one with a green one, and very quickly, you can start to do larger circuits.
A blue one is made light.
We can put a button in the middle and so we have a <unk>
If we change the button for a <unk> <unk> that is here, and now we have a <unk> light.
It <unk> this <unk> to create more impact and we have a noise.
I'm going to stop this.
So beyond simple play, <unk> are actually very powerful.
Instead of having to program, connecting and <unk> <unk> it allows us to program using very simple <unk>
To make <unk> faster, you just turn this button to be faster or slower.
The idea behind <unk> is that it's an increasing stream.
We want all interactions in the world to make it <unk> bricks to use.
<unk> sounds, solar panels, <unk> everything must be accessible.
We have given the kids to see them playing with them.
And it's been an incredible experience.
The best thing is how they start to understand the electronics of every day you don't learn in schools.
For example, how does a light at night, or why the door of an elevator gets open, or how an iPod responds to touch.
We've also led to design schools.
So for example, designers without experience any electronics start playing with <unk> like a material.
Here you can see, with bottles of paper and <unk> we have <unk> <unk>
<unk>   A few weeks ago, we took <unk> to the designers of Rhode Island designers who have no experience in engineering and just in cardboard, wood and paper and said, Do something.
Here's an example of a project that has made, a <unk> <unk> <unk>
But wait, here's my favorite project.
It's a <unk> <unk> which is a fear of darkness.
For these not engineers, <unk> became another material, electronics became another material.
And we want this material to all of us all.
So <unk> has open source.
You can visit the website, download all the design files and <unk>
We want to encourage a world of <unk> inventors and collaborators because this world in which we live, this interaction world is ours.
So ahead and <unk>
Thank you.
I'm going to tell you about unexpected discoveries.
I work in the solar industry.
And my little company is to get involved with the environment focusing on the environment.
<unk> collaboration.
This is a little video of what we do.
<unk> Wait a moment.
You can take a little bit in <unk>
<unk> we can continue to better leave the video on one side.
No.
This is not ...
All right.
Solar is ...
Oh, I am now struck by time?
All right. Thank you very much.
A couple years ago, I launched an initiative to recruit the best designers and technicians to take a year and work in an environment that represent almost everything that we are supposed to do, we asked them to work in government.
The initiative called <unk> for <unk> and it would be like <unk> Peace <unk>
We had some members every year and we put them to work with <unk>
Instead of sending them to the Third World We send them to the wild world.
They made great <unk> worked with <unk>
Their task is to show the possibilities of current technology.
<unk> <unk>
It's a <unk> in the city of Boston.
Here it comes up as if I would look for a quote, but what really looks for is that somebody to clean up when you get caught by snow because he knows it's not very good at driving fires when it's covered by one meter of snow.
How did it get to help for help in this way that <unk>
Last year in Boston we had a team of members of <unk> for <unk>
They were there in February and at that moment -- it was very much last year.
They realized that the city never wiped out these <unk>
But one of the members called Erik <unk> noticed something else: that citizens are going to <unk> the sidewalks right in front of them.
So he did like any good programmer, I developed an app.
It's a nice application where you can adopt a <unk>
You accept <unk> when you <unk>
In doing so, you put a name, in this case, put it <unk>
If you don't, someone can be <unk>
I mean, it has a <unk>
It's a modest application.
Maybe the smallest of the 21 applications are <unk> last year.
But it does something that no other technology of the <unk> government.
And it turned into viral way.
A responsible for <unk> City to see this app realized that I could use it, not for snow, but for citizens to have <unk>
It's very important to work these <unk> but people are stealing the batteries.
So he asks the citizens that <unk>
And then Seattle decided to use it to make the citizens <unk> the <unk> <unk>
And Chicago just <unk> to get people to <unk> to clean up sidewalks when they <unk>
So we now know about nine cities that are <unk> using it.
And this has been spread without <unk> organic and natural ways.
If you know a little bit about government technology, you know this doesn't happen yet.
The acquisition of software typically takes a couple of years.
Last year in Boston we had a team working on a project that took three people for two and a half months.
It was a tool for the parents to choose the best public school for their children.
Then they told us that the regular channels would have taken it at least two and two million dollars.
And that's nothing.
Now there is a project in the California court power to the moment two billion dollars and it doesn't work.
And there are projects like this in every level of government.
So an app that shows you in a couple of days and it was spreading into viral shape, is a kind of <unk> <unk> to the institution of government.
It suggests that the best way to work, not as in private companies as many people think that it should be.
Nor as a technology company, but as well as the Internet itself.
I mean, without constraints, <unk> and <unk>
And that's important.
But the most important thing about this application is that it represents ways to address the question of the government that has the new <unk> not as a problem of an <unk> institution but as a collective action problem.
And that's very good because it turns out that we are very good for the collective action with digital technology.
And there is a very large community of people who are building the tools that we are building together with efficacy.
And it's not only <unk> for <unk> but there are hundreds of people all over the country who contribute to <unk> apps every day in their own communities.
They're not given to the government.
They feel a lot of frustration before that, but they didn't get <unk>
And these people know something that we've lost of view.
And that is that if we leave the feelings about politics, the line in the <unk> <unk> <unk> and all of those other things that are taking us <unk> the government is essentially in the words of Tim <unk> "What we do together because alone we don't know.
Now, many people have abandoned the government.
If you are one of those people, I would ask you to do it because things are changing.
Politics is not <unk> the government itself.
And because the government ultimately made it out of -- remember that from <unk> the <unk> the way it would affect the way that change.
I didn't know a lot about government when I started with this.
And as a lot of people thought the government was to choose people to make them <unk>
Well, after two years I've come to the conclusion that the government is, especially about <unk>
This is the center of mobile care care and information.
It's the place that calls calls in the U.S.
Scott <unk> this call.
He <unk> on the basis of official knowledge.
I found nothing. He started with animal control.
And finally he said, "Hey, you can open the doors of the house, put music well and see if you <unk>
And it worked. So well by Scott.
But that was not the end of the <unk>
Boston doesn't have a conference center.
It has a phone and mobile <unk> called <unk> <unk>
They didn't take that application.
It was the work of very smart people from the Bureau of New York City <unk> in Boston.
One day, this really happened is this <unk> <unk> in my garbage garbage -- I don't know if it's dead.
How do I do for <unk>
The dynamic of <unk> <unk> is different.
Scott was talking about person.
In <unk> <unk> everything is public, so everybody can see this.
In this case, he saw a neighbor.
The next report said, "I went up to the place, I found the garbage cube behind the house.
<unk> Yes. <unk> Yes.
I went back the <unk> I went home.
Good night, sweet <unk>
Quite simple.
This is great. It's the confluence of the digital and the physicist.
And it's also a great example of the income income to collaboration, distributed voluntary collaboration.
But it's also a great example of government as a platform.
And here I don't necessarily mean the definition of the platform.
I'm talking about a platform so that people are <unk> and help others.
So, one citizen helped another but the government had a key role.
It connected the two people.
And it could have connected with the government service services, but the neighbor is a better alternative and cheaper than the government services.
When a neighbor helps another, <unk> communities.
If we call the animals, it costs a lot of money.
One important thing we have to think about the government is that it's not the same as politics.
A lot of people do it, but think that one is the entrance to the other.
That our entry to the government system is the vote.
How many times have you chosen to a political <unk> sometimes we spend a lot of energy to choose a new political leader and then we hope that the government to <unk> our values and <unk> our needs, but we don't see changes.
That is because the government is like an immense ocean and politics is the surface <unk> <unk>
That's what we call <unk>
And we say that word with a lot contempt.
But it is that <unk> what keeps us that out of that that we have financed as something that is operating on us, that something else, and at a consequence we're losing power.
People think politics is sexy.
If we want this institution to work, we'll have to make the bureaucracy to sexy.
Because that's where the real job work.
We have to collaborate with the machinery of government.
That makes the <unk> movement.
They have <unk>
It's a group of citizens concerned that have written a very detailed detailed report in response to the request of the <unk> <unk> of the financial reform project.
That's not political activism -- it's <unk> <unk>
And for those of us that we have <unk> to the government, it's time to ask us what world we want to leave our children.
You have to see the huge challenges that they are going to face.
Do you really think that we will get to where we need to go without solving the institution that can be <unk>
We can't do out of government, we need it to be more effective.
The good news is that with technology is that the technology is possible to rethink the government of government so that it can expand <unk> to civil society.
There's a generation that grew up with the Internet and knows that it's not that hard to act <unk> we just have to articulate the systems in the right way.
The average age of our members is 28 years old, so I <unk> I am a generation older than many of them.
This is a generation that's grown up by taking the word and giving that almost for granted.
They're not giving that battle that we all face about who is going to tell you, they're all going to talk.
They can express your opinions on any channel at the same time and do it.
So when you face the government problem they don't care about to hear your voices.
They're using your hands.
They get the work for the work to program apps that make the government work better.
And those applications allow us to use the hands to improve our communities.
It can be cleaning up a <unk> <unk> <unk> dumping a garbage cube that has a <unk> inside.
We may always have cleaned up those <unk> and many people do it.
But these applications are like digital <unk> that we're not only consumers, we're not only consumers of government we pay and we get services.
We're more than that: we are citizens.
And we're not going to fix the government until they don't <unk> the <unk>
So I want to ask everyone here, when it comes to the important things that we have to do together, all together, we're going to be a crowd of voices, or also we'll be a crowd of hands?
Thank you.
This is a real honor.
I've spent most of the time in prisons, prisons and death row.
I've spent most of my life in communities that have been involved in projects and places where there's a lot of despair.
And I'm here at TED looking at and hearing these <unk> has given me a lot of energy.
One of the things I've noticed in this short time is that TED has identity.
And the things they say here have impact around the world.
Sometimes if something come from TED, it has a sense and a force that wouldn't have any other way.
I say this because I think identity is <unk> important.
So here we've seen fantastic presentations.
And I think we've learned that the words of a teacher can make a lot of sense, but if they teach them with feeling, they can have a special meaning of it.
A doctor can do good things, <unk> if it's <unk> it can do much more.
So I want to talk about the power of identity.
I didn't really learn this in the practice of the law, my job.
I learned from my grandmother.
I grew up in a traditional house of a <unk> family, dominated by a <unk> which was my grandmother.
It was tough, it was strong, he had power.
It was the last word in every discussion in the family.
She <unk> many of the <unk> in our home.
It was a daughter of people who had been slaves.
Their parents were born in slavery in Virginia about <unk>
She was born about the <unk> and his experience with slavery <unk> the way I saw the world.
She was tough but she was also <unk>
When I was a little bit of and I looked at it, she was approaching and gave me a good <unk>
I was so strong that I could barely breathe and then <unk>
One or two hours later, I would come back to <unk> I was approaching and said, <unk> you still feel my <unk>
And if I said no, I get back again and say yes, I was leaving in peace.
I had this human quality that I would always want to want to be near it.
The only problem is that I had 10 children.
My mother was the lowest of 10.
Sometimes when I was going to spend a while with her, it wasn't easy to capture their time and her attention.
My cousins were running everywhere.
I remember when I was eight or nine years old, I woke up one morning, I went to the room and there were running all my cousins.
My grandmother was on the other side of the room and looked at me <unk>
I thought it was a game.
And so he looked at him and she <unk> but she was very serious.
After 15 or 20 minutes, she stood up, went through the room, he took me out of his hand, and he said, "Come on. The two are going to <unk>
I remember this as if it were yesterday.
I'll never forget it.
It took me outside and said, <unk> I'll tell you something, but you can't say it to <unk>
I said, "Okay, let's <unk>
She said, "Now I <unk> I don't read it. I said, "Sure."
And then he sat down, he looked at me and said, "I want you to know that I've been <unk>
And <unk> <unk> that you're <unk>
He said, "I think you can do what you want.
I'll never forget it.
Then he said, "Just do I want you to give me three things, <unk>
I said, <unk> <unk>
And he said, "The first thing I want you to tell me, is you want your mother."
<unk> "She is my <unk> and you have to <unk> that always <unk>
Like I went to my mom, I said, "Yes, <unk> so <unk>
Then he said to me, "The second I want you to tell me is that you will always do the right thing, even though the right thing is <unk>
I thought about it, and I said, "Yes, <unk> So <unk>
And then finally he said, "The third thing I want to tell you about is that you never <unk>
I was nine years old, and I said, "Yes, <unk> so <unk>
I grew up in the field, in rural <unk> I have a brother a year older and a little year.
When I was 14  15, one day my brother came home with a <unk> package I don't know where the <unk> took us to my sister and me and we went to the forest.
We are just doing the <unk> of the day.
He took a sip of beer, he offered my sister, she took a little and offered me to me.
I said, "No, no, no. It's okay. You <unk> but I'm not going to take <unk>
My brother said, <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
I already took something, your sister also.
I said, "No. I wouldn't feel good, you can <unk>
Then my brother <unk>
And he said, "What's going on? Take a <unk>
It was the <unk> look at the force and <unk> "Oh, not that you're still thinking about the conversation with <unk>
I said, "But what are you talking about?"
He said, <unk> tells you all the grandchildren that are <unk>
I was <unk>
I have to admit something to you.
I'll tell you something that's probably not supposed to say.
I know this is being spread <unk>
But I have 52 years old, and I can admit that I've never taken any alcohol.
I'm not saying this to be a <unk> I mean by the power of identity.
When we create the right type of identity, we say things to the other people who really don't see sense.
We can't get them to do things that they don't believe to do.
I think my grandmother naturally believed that all of their grandchildren were special.
My grandfather had been a prisoner during the <unk>
My children died of age-related diseases.
And these were the things that, according to her, we should <unk>
Now, I'll try to talk about our criminal justice system.
This country is very different than it was about 40 years ago.
In <unk> there were 300,000 prisoners.
Today there's 2.3 million.
In the U.S. we have the largest incarceration rate in the world.
We have seven million people in parole.
And this massive <unk> in my opinion, has changed fundamentally our world.
In poor and poor communities are so much <unk> so much despair.
One in three black between 18 and 30 years is in prison or the parole.
In urban <unk> across the country, Los Angeles, Philadelphia, Washington, Washington, from 50 to 60 percent of all the young color men are in jail, or the parole.
Our system is not only distorted in front of race, it's also about poverty.
In this country we have a court system that is much better if you're rich and <unk> that if you're poor and innocent.
It's not <unk> but wealth that affects the results.
And it seems to be very <unk>
The politics of fear and anger makes us believe that these are not a problem of ours.
We are <unk>
It seems interesting.
We're looking at our work some pretty curious developments in our work.
In my state, in Alabama, as well as in other states, we have copyright <unk> if you have a criminal <unk>
Right now in Alabama, the <unk> of black male population has lost the right to vote.
And if we put it into the next 10 years, the level of loss of rights will be as high as it was before we <unk> the law of the right to vote.
We have this awesome silence.
I represent children.
Many of my customers are very young.
America is the only country in the world where it sentence to 13 years to die in prison.
We have this country in prison for children, without any chance to come in.
Now we're in the process of some <unk>
The only country in the world.
<unk> people in death row.
This issue of death penalty is interesting.
In a certain sense that you've got to think that the final question is, people deserve to die by the <unk> <unk>
A very sensitive question.
But you can think of another way of how we are in our identity.
There's another form of <unk> it's not about deciding whether people deserve to die for <unk> <unk> but if we deserve to kill.
This is interesting.
<unk> death penalty in America is defined by error.
From every nine <unk> people have identified an innocent who is <unk> and liberated from death row.
A mistake, <unk> <unk> an innocent <unk>
This is interesting.
In aviation it would not be allowed to fly airplanes if in every nine that <unk> you would have a <unk>
But somehow we get rid of the problem.
It's not our problem.
It's not our charge.
It's not our struggle.
I talk a lot about these things.
I'm talking about race and this issue of whether we deserve to kill.
It's interesting that in my classes with students about <unk> <unk> I talk about slavery.
I talk to you about terrorism, the time it started at the end of the reconstruction and that lasted for the Second World War.
We really don't know a lot about this.
But for the black Americans in this country, it was sort of defined by terror.
In many communities people were afraid to be <unk>
They were worried to be <unk>
The terror threat was what defined his lives.
Now there are older people who come up to me and say, "Mr. Stevenson, you teach talks, you want to give people to stop saying that in our history, we cope for the first time with terrorism, after <unk>
They ask me to say, "No. Say that we grew up with that."
The age of terrorism went on, obviously, with segregation and decades of <unk> racial and separation.
In this country we have a dynamic why we don't like to talk about our problems.
We don't like to talk about our story.
And that's why we haven't understood the meaning of what we've historically done.
All of the time we had to do with each other.
We constantly created tensions and conflict.
It costs us work to talk about races. I think it's because we're not willing to engage with a process of truth and reconciliation.
In South Africa, people understood that you couldn't overcome <unk> race without a commitment to truth and reconciliation.
In Rwanda, even before the genocide had this commitment, but in this country we haven't done it.
I was in Germany giving talks about death row.
It was fascinating because one of the teachers stood up after my presentation and said, "You know it's good for listening to what you <unk>
<unk> We have no death penalty in Germany.
We will never be able to have it here."
The room stayed quietly and a lady said, "There's no way that we have our history, we can never get to the systematic death of human beings.
It would be irrational that we <unk> <unk> and <unk> we would put them to <unk>
<unk> about this.
How would we feel in a world where a nation like Germany, <unk> people, especially if they were mostly <unk>
We couldn't afford it.
It would be irrational.
And yet, there is this disconnection.
I think our identity is in danger.
If we don't really care about these hard issues, the positive things and wonderful things are, however, <unk>
We love innovation.
We're fascinated by technology, <unk> creativity.
We love entertainment.
But lately, those realities are <unk> by suffering, abuse, <unk> <unk>
In my view, we need to integrate both of these things.
I've been talking about the need to have more hope, more commitment, more dedication with the basic challenges of life in this complex world.
I think that means to spend more time thinking about and talking about the poor, the <unk> the ones that never come to TED.
And thinking about them is, in some ways, something that is within our being.
It's true that we have to believe in issues that we haven't seen.
We are. In spite of being so rational, so committed to the intellectual <unk>
The development with creativity. The development comes from not just brain ideas.
These things come from ideas -- also by the heart of the heart.
This connection of the mind is what drives us to look at not just how bright and <unk> but also in the dark and the hard thing.
<unk> <unk> the great <unk> leader was talking about this.
He said, "When we were in East Europe suffering from the <unk> we wanted all sorts of things, but mainly what we needed was hope, orientation to spirit, a will to be in places of despair and to be <unk>
Well, that orientation for the spirit is pretty much at the heart of what I think, even in communities like TED, should be <unk>
There's no <unk> related to technology and design, that allows us to be truly human if we don't pay attention to poverty, to <unk> to inequality, to injustice.
Now I want to tell you that these thoughts make up a much more challenging identity, that if we are ignoring these things.
We go back to <unk>
I had the great privilege, being a very young lawyer to meet Rosa <unk>
These women were together just to talk about.
Occasionally, Mrs. <unk> called me to say, <unk> comes the <unk> <unk> We're going to come together to talk.
You want to come and <unk>
I said, "Yes, lady. I do."
So she said, "Well what are you going to do when you <unk>
I <unk> <unk>
So I was going and just <unk>
It was very <unk> very <unk>
And on one occasion, I was there, listening to these <unk> and after a couple hours, Mrs. Parks ran to me and said, "Now, <unk> me give me this idea of justice justice.
Tell me what you're trying to do."
And I started to give my speech.
And I said, "Well, we're trying to question injustice.
We try to help those who have been doomed <unk>
We try to confront prejudice and discrimination in the criminal justice administration.
We try to end the <unk> of life, without freedom for the children.
We try to do something about death row.
We try to reduce the population in prisons.
We try to end the <unk> <unk>
I gave it all my best speech and finally looked at me and said, <unk> <unk> <unk>
And <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
At that time, Mrs. <unk> got <unk> he put my finger on the face and said, "That's why you have to be very <unk>
I think actually, the TED community has to be much more <unk>
We need to figure out how to address those challenges, those problems, that suffering.
Because finally humanity depends on compassion for others.
I've learned some very simple things in my work.
I've been educated in simple things.
I have come to understand and believe that every one of us is higher than the worst thing we've ever met.
I think that's true for everybody on the planet.
I'm convinced that if someone says a lie, it's not because it's a liar.
I'm sure if someone takes something that doesn't tell you, it's not a <unk>
Even if somebody kills each other, it's not a <unk>
This is why I think there's a basic dignity in people who should be <unk> by the law.
I also think that in many parts of this country and, certainly in many parts of the world, the opposite of poverty is not wealth.
That's not it.
I really think that in many parts of poverty is justice.
And finally, I think although it's very <unk> very beautiful, very <unk> very <unk> we don't judge our technology, for our designs, or for our intellectual capacity or rational.
At the end of the <unk> the character of a society, not by the way they treat the rich, powerful, <unk> but in the way they treat the poor, <unk> prisoners.
Because it's in this context as we start to understand truly profound issues about what we are.
I feel <unk> I'm going to end up with a story.
Sometimes I do too much force.
<unk> <unk> like everybody.
Sometimes those ideas go beyond my <unk> in a major way.
I've been representing these guys who have been <unk> with a lot of <unk>
I'm going to prison and I see my customers of 13 and 14 years who have been <unk> so that they were <unk> as adults were <unk>
And I start thinking, how can it be?
How can a judge make someone in what isn't it?
The judge <unk> as an adult, but I see a child.
One night too late was <unk> by God, if the judge can become something that you don't are, you have to have magical powers.
Yes, <unk> the judge has magical powers.
You should ask for some of that.
As I was so late, I couldn't think correctly, but I started working on a <unk>
I had a <unk> customer and a <unk> black.
I started working on <unk> with a <unk> who said, <unk> for my <unk> black customer is treated as a <unk> privileged white <unk> of a <unk>
In the <unk> I put that there was been <unk> behavior in <unk> in the behavior of the police and in the process.
There was a <unk> line on how in this country there is no ethics, but a lack of ethics.
The next morning I woke up thinking that <unk> <unk> would be a dream, or actually the <unk>
For my horror, not only had <unk> it had sent to court.
It took about two months, I had already forgotten it.
And finally <unk> my God, I have to go to court for this case, stupid.
I got to the car and I felt truly <unk> <unk>
I went on to court.
I thought this would be very difficult and <unk>
I finally dropped out of the car he walked to court.
I was going up the stairs when I found myself with a black man <unk> was the <unk> of court.
When he saw me, he came up to me and said, "Who is you?"
I said, "I'm a <unk> he <unk> "Is you <unk> I said yes.
So I approached it, and I <unk>
And I was <unk> in the ear.
He said, "I'm proud of <unk>
I have to tell you now that that was <unk>
That connected deeply through my interior, with my identity with the ability we all have to contribute to the community with a vision of hope.
Well, I went into the <unk>
When he arrived, the judge saw me.
And he said, "Mr. Stevenson, you wrote this bold <unk>
I said, "Yes, Mr. <unk>
People started getting there. They were all <unk>
I was the one that had written those <unk>
The policemen -- the prosecutors <unk> the <unk>
Suddenly without knowing how, the room was full of people -- all right, because we talked about races, because we were talking about poverty, because we talked about inequality.
With the <unk> of the eye I got to see the <unk> that was going and <unk>
I just looked out the window and I would try to hear that <unk>
<unk> walking over here and there.
Finally, this old black black, with a face of <unk> walked into the room and sat behind me, almost on the table of lawyers.
About 10 minutes later, the judge <unk> a <unk>
During the break a <unk> <unk> showed <unk> because the <unk> had come in the room.
The <unk> <unk> on the old black <unk>
And he said, <unk> what do you do in the <unk>
And the old black man stood up, looked at the <unk> looked at me and he looked at me and said, "I went back to this young man to tell this young woman to keep his view in the <unk>
I've come to TED today because I think many of you understand that the moral arc of the universe is very large, but it folds up towards justice.
We cannot be truly human <unk> if we don't care about human rights and for dignity.
That our survival is linked to each other.
That our visions of technology, design, entertainment and creativity must <unk> to <unk> <unk> and justice.
And above all, to those of the people who share this, I just want to tell you that keep your view in the objective of <unk>
Thank you very much.
Chris Anderson: <unk> to hear and see a evident in the audience of this community, to help in your <unk> to do something.
Something that is not a check. What can we do?
<unk> There are several opportunities close to me.
If you live in the state of California, for example, there will be a <unk> this spring in which you will make an effort to <unk> the funds that are now spent in policy today.
For example, here in California, you're going to spend a billion dollars on death row, in the next five years, a billion dollars.
And despite this, the <unk> of the <unk> cases not <unk> in <unk>
<unk> of rapes do nothing at all.
Here's a chance of change.
This <unk> is going to come up to propose that these funds to make it turn the law at safety.
I think there's a very close opportunity.
CA: There's been a huge decline in <unk> in the United States, in the last three decades.
Part of the explanation, you say it has to do with the largest <unk> rate.
What would you say to those who believe that is?
<unk> Actually, the rate of <unk> with violence has remained relatively stable.
The vast growth in massive <unk> in this country is not for crimes with violence.
It's the wrong war on Drugs.
That's why this dramatic increase in the <unk> population.
And we let us convince the rhetoric of the punishment.
We have three legal causes to bring people to the supply chain to steal a bicycle, for small crimes against property, rather than making it <unk> those resources to their victims.
I think we need to do more to help the victims of the <unk> and not less.
It seems to me that our present philosophy of punishment does nothing for anybody.
I think that's the orientation that has to change.
CA: <unk> have you excited about here today.
You're very inspiring.
Thank you very much for me to come to TED. Thank you.

Oh, my God.
Peter <unk> These are just some of the clips that I got in the last six months <unk> could be the last six days or the last six years.
The idea is that the press media would prefer to <unk> the negative news because our minds are paying attention.
And that responds to a very good reason.
In every second of the day our senses are getting so much more data than probably the brain can <unk>
And as nothing cares about to survive, the first stop of all of this data is an old bit of the temporal lobe called <unk>
The amygdala is our early warning detector.
<unk> and recorded all the information looking for something in the environment that could make the damage.
So from a <unk> of stories, <unk> to look at the <unk>
That old <unk> saying <unk> "If there are blood, <unk> is very true.
And because all digital devices provide a negative news for the seven days or 24 hours a day, no wonder that we are <unk>
It's not surprising that people think the world is going to be wrong in worse.
But maybe it's not that way.
Maybe instead, what really happens is we get <unk>
Perhaps the tremendous progress done in the last century by a series of forces is <unk> so that we have the potential to create a world of abundance in the next three decades.
I'm not saying that we don't have our good problems problem: the climate change, the <unk> of water and <unk> without some doubts we have.
As human beings, we are very good at <unk> the problems, and in the long run, we ended up with them.
<unk> then what happened in the last century to see where we go.
In the last hundred years, the average of life has more than <unk> average income per capita income for inflation has been <unk> across the world.
Child mortality mortality has reduced 10 times.
Also, the cost of food, of electricity, of transportation and communications, has fallen from 10 to 1,000 times.
Steve <unk> showed us that we're living the most peaceful time of human history.
And Charles <unk> that the global literacy happened from 25 to more than 80 percent of the last 130 years.
We're really living an extraordinary time.
A lot of people do it.
And we continue to <unk> <unk>
In fact, <unk> the meaning of poverty.
<unk> today in America, large part of the people who live under the poverty line have electricity, water, <unk> <unk> phones, air conditioning and air conditioning and <unk>
The <unk> <unk> of the <unk> <unk> the <unk> on the planet, would never have dreamed of such <unk>
It's a lot of the technology and <unk> its exponential growth.
My good friend Ray Kurzweil showed that any tool that <unk> in the information technology jumps on this curve, Moore's Law Act, and doubling the performance of the price for about 12 to 24 months.
And so the mobile phone that you have in your pocket is a million times cheaper and a thousand times faster than a supercomputer from the '70s.
Now look at this curve.
It's Moore's Law for the last hundred years.
I want you to watch two things on this curve.
First, the soft thing that is -- in good times, in war and peace, in recession on depression and <unk>
It's the end of computers used to build faster.
It doesn't stop any of the great challenges.
And even though it's <unk> on a law on the left, it goes curve up.
The growth rate of technology is more and faster.
And on this curve, I think of Moore's Law, there's a series of extraordinarily powerful technologies that we have today.
The computation in the cloud, that my friends of <unk> call computer computation and sensors and networks, the robotic printing and its ability to democratize and distribute personalized production around the planet, synthetic biology, the fuels, vaccines and food, the <unk> and the <unk> the <unk> and the <unk>
I mean, how many of you saw the victory in the "Jeopardy" of Watson, <unk>
It was <unk>
I looked at the newspapers the best headline to <unk>
And I loved this: <unk> <unk> <unk>
"Jeopardy" is not an easy game.
Play with the <unk> of human language.
Imagine this artificial intelligence in the cloud, available to all of the cell phone.
Four years ago, here at TED, Ray Kurzweil and I, we launched a new university called <unk> <unk>
We taught these technologies to our students, and in particular, how can they be used to solve the great challenges of humanity.
And each year, we asked them to release a company, or a product or service that may affect the lives of a billion people in a decade.
Think about that, the fact that a group of students today can impact the lives of a billion people.
Thirty years ago, I would have <unk> absurd.
Today we can point out a <unk> of companies that have already done.
When I think about creating plenty, it doesn't mean to create <unk> life for each of the <unk> it's about creating a life of possible.
This is about taking that <unk> and making it <unk>
You see, <unk> is <unk> and technology is a force that releases resources.
I'll give you an example.
It's a story of Napoleon <unk> in the <unk>
He's the guy on the left.
<unk> to dinner the king of <unk>
The troops from Napoleon ate with <unk> silver, and the same <unk> with <unk> gold.
But the king of <unk> ate with <unk>
You see, aluminum was the most valuable metal of the planet, it was worth more than gold and <unk>
For that reason, the tip of the Washington Washington is of aluminum.
You see, even though aluminum is the <unk> of the Earth, it doesn't come as a pure <unk>
It's tied by oxygen and <unk>
But then he got the <unk> and he made the aluminum something so cheap that we use it as a <unk>
<unk> this analogy to the future.
Let's think about energy.
Ladies and gentlemen, we're on a planet that are <unk> by 5,000 times more energy than we use in a year.
They come to the Earth 16 <unk> of energy every 88 minutes.
It's not about <unk> but <unk>
And there's good news.
This year, for the first time, the cost of solar power in India is 50 percent less than the <unk> of <unk> <unk> rupees versus 17 rupees.
The cost of solar power dropped 50 percent last year.
Last month, MIT published a study that shows that at the end of the decade, in the U.S. parts of the United States, solar power will cost six cents <unk> per hour compared to 15 cents in the national average.
And if we have abundance of energy, we also have abundance of water.
Let's talk about the wars in the water.
Do you remember when Carl Sagan pointed at the spacecraft Voyager spacecraft in the Earth, in 1990, after it passed away.
<unk> a famous photo. <unk>
"A <unk> <unk>
Because we live on a planet of water.
We live on a planet covered in 70 percent water.
Yes, the <unk> is saltwater, two percent of the ice is ice, and we fought for the world's water <unk> but there's also one hope.
It's an available technology not in 10 or 20 years, but right now.
This is the nanotechnology, the <unk>
In a conversation with Dean Kamen this morning, one of the innovators in <unk> I'd like to share with you, he gave me permission to <unk> their technology called <unk> <unk> -- it's the size of a small refrigerator.
It's capable of generating a thousand gallons of water to the day of any source of any source -- saltwater, <unk> water <unk> for less than two cents a gallon.
The president of Coke just who will make a significant test of hundreds of these units in the developing world.
If that comes out well, and I have full confidence that this is how it will be, Coke will implement it in <unk> countries on the planet.
This is an <unk> innovation for this technology that is today.
And we've seen it in mobile phones.
My God, we're going to get to the 70 percent penetration of mobile phones in the developing world for the end of 2013.
<unk> that mighty warrior has better mobile communications in the middle of Kenya that President Reagan 25 years ago.
And by having a smartphone with Google, it has access to more knowledge and information that President Clinton 15 years ago.
She lives in a world of abundance of information and communications that no one could have happened.
So better than that, the things that you and I have paid tens and hundreds of thousands of dollars -- video -- video <unk> images, of books and music, technology <unk> technology now <unk> and lose value value with cell phones.
Maybe the best thing to come up when it comes to the health applications.
Last month, I had the pleasure to announce with the <unk> Foundation, which was called the X Prize, <unk> <unk> 10 million dollars.
We are challenging the teams of the world so that we can take these technologies into a mobile device that they talk, and because they have <unk> they can get blood from your finger.
To win it has to make better diagnostics than a certificate.
Imagine this device in the middle of the developing world where there is no doctors, where the burden of <unk> is 25 percent and there are <unk> of health workers.
When this device <unk> a RNA virus or DNA that you don't want to call the <unk> and first of all, stop that the pandemic was happening.
But this is the biggest force of producing a world of abundance.
I call it the one billion increasing.
The white lines here are the population.
We've just got the <unk> <unk>
By the way, the best protection against population explosion is to give the world of education and health.
In 2010, we had less than two billion people online, connected.
By 2020, it's about two billion to five billion Internet users.
Three billion minds never before <unk> to the global conversation.
What would these people want these people?
What a <unk> What wishes we want?
And instead of economic collapse, we have the greatest economic injection in history.
These people represent tens of trillions of dollars in the global economy.
And most health care thanks to the <unk> of a better education with Khan Academy and due to the use of 3D prints and computation in the cloud will be more productive than ever before.
What can we give us three billion more members of human humanity, healthy and <unk>
How about some voices never before <unk>
What if we give the oppressed, wherever they are, a voice to be heard and be able to act for the first time?
What would these three dollars?
And if they are contributions we can't <unk>
One thing that I learned with the X Prize is that small equipment, guided by its passion with a clear goal, they can do things that were only able to do the big corporations and governments.
I'm going to end up sharing a story that really bothers me.
There's a program that maybe some of you know.
It's called <unk>
<unk> at the University of Washington in Seattle.
It's a game where people can take a sequence of amino acids and figure out how the protein.
<unk> determine the structure and functionality.
It's a very important thing in medical research.
And so far, I was a problem of <unk>
They've played this with this college professors, among others.
Then hundreds of thousands of people joined together and started <unk>
And it has been shown today that the machinery of human patterns is better by folding proteins than the best computers.
Ladies and gentlemen, which gives me an enormous confidence in the future is that today, we have more power to take the biggest challenges on the planet.
We have the tools with this exponential technology.
We have the <unk> of the <unk>
We have the capital of the <unk>
And we have three billion minds of new minds that we can get together to work on the solution of big challenges and do what we should do.
We have in front of some extraordinary decades.
Thank you.
I'm going to talk about a very <unk> idea.
The <unk> of the <unk>
And as the idea can be explained in a minute, before I'll give you three examples to make time.
The first story is about Charles Darwin, one of my heroes.
He was here, as you know, in <unk>
Maybe they believed that <unk> <unk> but it wasn't like that.
It actually <unk> fish.
And he described one of them as a <unk>
It was <unk>
It was caught very much to the <unk>
Now the fish is in the Red Cross <unk>
But we've heard this story many times about Galapagos and other places, so that doesn't have anything special.
But the case is we still come in the Galapagos.
We still think they're <unk>
<unk> still say they're still <unk>
So what's going on here?
The second story, it also illustrates another concept.
Because I was there in <unk> studying a <unk> in West Africa.
I was there because I grew up in Europe and then wanted to work in Africa.
I thought I could <unk>
I burned so much with the sun and I was convinced that I wasn't there.
This is my first exposure to the sun.
The <unk> was surrounded by <unk> and, as you can see, from a <unk>
There were <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
And the fishing of this <unk> was very abundant and passed for a good time, so it was getting more than half in Ghana.
When I went there 27 years later the amount of fish had gone down in half.
<unk> to the five centimeters.
You have a genetic pressure.
There was still fish.
In a way, they still were happy.
And the fish were still happy to be there.
I mean, nothing to changed, but everything has changed.
My third story is that I was complicit in the introduction of <unk> fishing <unk> in Southeast Asia.
In the 1970s -- <unk> started in <unk> Europe did a lot of development projects.
The fishing development was also imposing the countries that already had 100,000 <unk> <unk> <unk> industrial fishing.
And this boat, quite good, <unk> <unk>
I went out to fish out in it, and we had studies in southern China and <unk> and, above all, in the <unk> Sea.
What we used to capture was something <unk>
<unk> I know, the bottom of the sea.
Ninety percent of what we capture were <unk> other animals that are in the bottom.
And most of the fish are <unk> tiny ones about <unk> remains of coral reefs.
In short, the sea floor came to the deck and then it was <unk>
These images are extraordinary because the transition is very fast.
In a year, you make a study and then start the commercial fishing.
The bottom line is a solid background of soft coral in this case, to be a <unk>
This is a <unk> <unk>
Not the <unk> The <unk> because they were dead.
We once captured a alive.
I was still not <unk>
And so they wanted to <unk> because it was a good food.
This mountain of remains is what the fishermen collect every time they go to an area where they have never fish.
But there was no <unk>
We <unk> the world, but we don't remember it.
We <unk> the point of start to start a new level, not remember what was there.
If you look at this something like this.
On the Y-axis, we have things like <unk> biodiversity, number of whales, the <unk> of the country, the water supply.
And that changes over time. It changes because people do things with <unk>
Every generation will use the <unk> images in the beginning of their conscious life as normal and <unk> forward.
The difference is that they perceive loss.
But they don't perceive the loss that happened before.
You can analyze the string of changes.
And at the end of the end of the <unk> remains.
And that, in fact, is we want to do it now.
We want to keep things that don't are, or they're not what they were.
But you should think that this problem is affecting people when societies <unk> kill animals without knowing what they've done to a few generations later.
Because, obviously, an animal that's very plentiful, before <unk> is <unk>
You don't lose animal animals.
You lose <unk> animals.
Even if this is not perceived as a great loss.
Over time, we focused on large animals, and in a sea with great fish.
They become <unk> because the <unk>
We have a few fish, but we think that's the point of <unk>
And the question is, why do we accept this?
Well, because we don't know it was different.
In fact, a lot of people, scientists, <unk> who was very different.
And they will do it because the evidence presented in an earlier way, is not the way they would expect the evidence.
For example, the anecdote that some of the <unk> like captain such as a captain and maybe looked at a lot of fish in this area cannot be used or, usually they don't use the scientists in the fishing, because it's not <unk>
So we have a situation where people don't know the past, even though we lived in <unk> societies, because they don't rely on the sources of the past.
There the huge role that can be transformed from a protected marine area.
Because with the marine protected areas, we really visualize the past.
<unk> the past people cannot conceive of because the starting point has been run and it's extremely low.
That's for the people that you can see a marine marine zone and can benefit from the vision that <unk> which allows them to erase their point.
And what about the people who can't do it because they have no access, like people in the Middle West -- for example?
I think that the arts and movie may probably fill the vacuum. The simulation.
This is a simulation of <unk> Bay.
A long time ago, there was gray whales in <unk> Bay, 500 years ago.
And you may have noticed that <unk> and <unk> are like <unk>
And if you think about <unk> if you think about what people were <unk> with the movie <unk> talk about the story of <unk> why do they <unk>
Because it raises something that in a sense, it has been lost.
That's why my <unk> the only one that giving, is to Cameron, we do <unk> <unk> underwater.
Thank you very much.
Hi. I'm Kevin <unk> the <unk> <unk> manager and I look at YouTube videos.
It's true.
So today, we're going to see why the videos are <unk> and how important it has that.
We all want to be <unk> <unk> <unk>
But today the web video does that any of us, or our actions, copper organs in a part of our global culture.
You can get famous on the Internet in a <unk>
They go up over 48 hours of video to YouTube per minute.
And of those, only a small percentage is viral takes a myriad of <unk> <unk> <unk>
How does that happen?
Three things: <unk> communities of participation and <unk>
Well, <unk>
<unk> <unk> Oh my God, my God.
Oh my God!
Wow.
<unk> <unk>
KA: Last year, <unk> <unk> published this video shot outside his house in <unk> National Park.
In 2010, it was seen 23 million times.
This chart shows the <unk> of the popularity of last summer.
<unk> was not telling you to do a viral video.
I just wanted to share a double double <unk>
That's what you do if it's called Mountain <unk>
There were a lot of video published in nature.
This video was published in January.
So what happened here?
He was Jimmy <unk>
Jimmy <unk> published this <unk> that <unk> the video to <unk>
The creators of trends like Jimmy <unk> are presented with new and interesting things and <unk> them into a wider audience.
Rebecca <unk>  It's Friday, Friday. You have to start the Friday.   You all want to come up with a week, the weekend.   <unk> Facebook, <unk> a Friday.  KA: You wouldn't think that we can have this conversation without talking about this video, I hope.
<unk> of Black Rebecca is one of the most popular videos of the year.
They saw it almost 200 million times this year.
This graph shows the frequency of use.
Like <unk> <unk> this video seemed to have come out of nowhere.
So what happened this day?
Well, it was Friday, it's true.
And if you ask for those other <unk> they're also a Friday.
But what happened this day, this Friday <unk>
Well, I took it, and so many blogs started writing about it.
Michael J. <unk> of <unk> Science was one of the first people in making a joke about video on Twitter.
But the important thing is that one person or a group of trends embrace a view and they share it with a broader audience, accelerating the process.
So, this whole community of people who shares this big internal <unk> then starts talking about that and doing things.
And now there are 10,000 <unk> <unk> on YouTube.
Just in the first seven days, there was a parody for each other days.
Unlike the <unk> entertainment of the 20th century, this communal participation is our way to be part of the <unk> phenomenon, or doing something new with <unk>
<unk> <unk> is an <unk> animation, with a <unk> music.
That's it.
This year, you saw it about 50 million times.
And if you think that's weird, you know that there's a three-year-old version that has seen four million times.
Even cats saw this video.
And there are cats that saw other cats see the video.
But the important thing here is creativity that woke up between the Internet <unk> community.
There was <unk>
Someone made an old version of the old one.
And then it became international <unk>
All of a sudden, a whole community of <unk> community that made this happen to be a dumb joke to something that we all can form part.
Because today not just <unk> <unk>
Who could have predicted something like this?
Who could have predicted <unk> <unk> or <unk> Black or <unk> <unk>
What script could we have written that <unk> this situation?
In a world where you go up two days video days per minute -- just the single, unexpected thing can be <unk> the way these things have done.
When a friend of mine told me that I had to see this great video of a guy who protest against <unk> in New York, I admit that I wasn't interested in too much.
Casey <unk> I was <unk> not circular by the <unk> but often there are obstacles that keep you apart from the <unk>
KA: Thanks to the surprise effect, and his humor, Casey <unk> managed to get five million you saw and understand their idea.
So this approach is worth all the new things that we do in a creative form.
And all of this leads us to a great question.
<unk> <unk> What does this mean?
<unk>
KA: What does this mean?
<unk> public communities.
As I said earlier, one of the current celebrities of the world, Justin <unk> started on YouTube.
Don't <unk> permission to express your ideas.
Now we're all a little <unk> of our pop culture.
These are not the characteristics of the old media -- they are barely the current media -- but they will <unk> the entertainment entertainment.
Thank you.
This is not a <unk> story.
It's a puzzle that's still <unk>
Let me tell you about some of the pieces.
Imagine the first <unk> a man burning the work of a whole life.
This is a poet, a <unk> a man whose entire life had been supported by the unique hope of unit and freedom of his country.
<unk> while the <unk> come into the <unk> they come into the fact that their life had been totally in vain.
The words, for so long my friends, I now <unk> it.
It was <unk> in silence.
He died <unk> for history.
He's my grandfather.
I never met him.
But our lives are much more than our memories.
My grandmother never allowed me to forget his story.
My task was not to let that have been in <unk> and my lesson was to learn that the story tried to <unk> but <unk>
The next part of the puzzle is on the dawn of <unk> <unk> into the sea.
My mother, <unk> was only 18 years old when his father died, and a <unk> marriage and two small girls were <unk>
For her, life had gone to a <unk> task for his family and a new life in Australia.
It was <unk> for her that I couldn't do that.
And after a <unk> of four years that challenges the fiction, a boat fell into the ocean dressed of <unk>
Every adults knew the risks.
The biggest fear were <unk> the rape and death.
Like most adults, my mother carried a <unk> <unk>
If we were <unk> first we would take my sister and I, and then she and grandmother.
My first memories are from that boat, the steady rate of the engine, the <unk> diving into every wave, and the vast and empty horizon.
I don't remember hackers who came over several times, but they were <unk> with the bravery of men on our boat, or the motor dying and not be able to start for six hours.
But I do remember the lights of the oil platform in front of the coast of Malaysia, and the young man who collapsed and died, I finished the journey was too much for it; and the first apple I tried, given by the men on the platform.
No apple had the same flavor.
After three months in a refugee camp, <unk> in <unk>
And the next piece of the puzzle is about four women over three generations, shaping a new life together.
We set up in <unk> a suburb of <unk> <unk> whose population is comprised of <unk>
Unlike the <unk> suburbs of the middle class whose existence was <unk> there was no sense of the right.
The smells that came from shops were the rest of the world.
And the fragments of English <unk> <unk> among people who had one thing in common: They were starting again.
My mother worked in farms, then on a car assembly line, working six days, double turn.
Yet, I found time to study English and get a title at I.T. <unk>
We were poor.
All the dollars were <unk> and established an extra tutoring in English and mathematics, it wouldn't matter what was supposed to be <unk> which was generally <unk> <unk> always <unk>
Two pairs in school, one to hide the holes in the other.
A school uniform to the <unk> because I had to last six years.
And there was strange <unk> and <unk> on the <unk> <unk> and some <unk> <unk> <unk> again.
And home, where do we do?
Something in me is <unk>
He was <unk> determination and a voice that said, "I'm going to <unk>
My mother, my sister and I <unk> in the same bed.
My mother was <unk> every night, but we were <unk> on our day and <unk> the movements of our grandmother.
My mother suffered from <unk> all the boat.
And my task was to be awake until their nightmares started to be able to <unk>
She opened a computer store, then I studied to be <unk> and opened another business.
And women would come with their stories about men who couldn't make the transition angry and angry and <unk> kids trapped between two worlds.
They were looked for subsidies and <unk>
And they were created centers.
I lived in worlds.
On one, it was the student of <unk> classical <unk> with what it was about myself.
On the other, I was <unk> in <unk> lives, tragically <unk> by violence, drug abuse and <unk>
But a lot of them got aid over the years.
And for that work, when I was studying my last year, I was elected by the young Australian young of the year.
And I was <unk> from one piece of the puzzle to the other, but the edges of the puzzle are not <unk>
So <unk> <unk> resident <unk> was now so <unk> refugee and social activist invited to speak in sites that had never heard <unk> and in houses whose existence would never have imagined.
I didn't know the <unk>
I didn't know how to use <unk>
I didn't know how to talk about wine.
I didn't know how to talk about anything.
I wanted to retreat to the <unk> and the happy life of life in a suburb of <unk> -- a grandmother, a mother and two daughters ending the day as they did for almost 20 years, <unk> on the day of each other and <unk> <unk> the three still in the same bed.
And I said to my mom who couldn't do it.
It reminded me that I had now the same age that she had when we got the ship.
The "no" had never been an option.
He said to me, "What are you not <unk>
So I talked about <unk> juvenile and education and <unk> to the marginalized and the <unk>
And the more I was talking about, the more I was <unk> to talk about.
I met people from all the roads of life, many of them doing what they were doing, living on the border of possible.
And although I finished my <unk> I realized I couldn't stay in a career of <unk>
It had to be another piece of the puzzle.
And I realized at the same time that it's okay to be a stranger, a <unk> new one on the scene -- and not just that it's fine, but it's something that is because it's a gift of the ship.
Because being inside can easily mean <unk> <unk> can easily mean to accept the assumptions of your <unk>
I gave enough steps out of my happy zone to know that, yes, the world <unk> but not the way we fear it.
<unk> that wouldn't have been <unk> they were <unk>
There was a energy there, an optimism <unk> a rare mix of humility and <unk>
So I kept my intuition.
<unk> a small group of people who the slogan cannot <unk> was a <unk> challenge.
For one year, we didn't have a <unk>
At the end of every day, he made a giant pot of soup that everybody <unk>
<unk> to you at night.
Most of our ideas were crazy, but some brilliant <unk> and we opened up.
It took the decision to move to the U.S.
after a single journey.
My <unk> again.
Three months later, I had <unk> and adventure <unk>
Before I finish, let me tell you about my grandmother.
She grew up in a time when the <unk> was the social norm and the local <unk> was the person who cared.
Life hadn't changed for centuries.
His father died shortly after she was born.
The mother grew up alone.
At 17 it became a <unk> of a <unk> whose mother <unk>
Without support of his husband, he caused an <unk> to the <unk> and carrying the cause itself, and much more <unk> caused when I won it.
He cannot be done to be wrong.
I was in the shower in the room in a hotel in <unk> when she went to 1,000 miles in <unk>
I looked through the <unk> of the shower and I saw him stop the other side.
I knew I had come to <unk>
My mother called minutes later.
Days later, later, we went to a Buddhist temple.
We tell we stories and ensure that we were still with it.
At night, a monk came and told us that I had to close the <unk>
My mother asked us to raise your hand.
I asked the <unk> "Why his hand is hot, and the rest of the body is so <unk>
"Because you have taken your hand from the <unk> he said.
<unk> have not <unk>
If there's a nerve in our family, that runs through women.
Since those of us who were and how life came to us, we can now see that the men that would have come to our lives would have been <unk>
The defeat would have easily <unk>
Now I want to have my own kids, and I wonder about the boat.
Who could do that for you?
But I fear the privilege of how easy to the right one.
I can give you a <unk> in their lives, a brave in every wave, the <unk> rate of the engine, the steady horizon that doesn't guarantee nothing?
I don't know.
But if I could take it and look at them and look at it, I would do it.
<unk> <unk> and also the mother of <unk> is here today, in the fourth or fifth row.
My story starts in <unk> about two years ago.
I was in the desert, under the <unk> sky, with the <unk> <unk> <unk>
We were having a conversation about how nothing has changed since the time of the ancient Indian <unk>
In those days when Indians wanted to travel <unk> to a car and <unk> the sky.
Now we do it with airplanes.
And then when I was <unk> the great prince prince Indian <unk> I was <unk> pulled up an arc and with a <unk> on the floor, <unk> water.
Now we do the same with <unk> and machines.
The conclusion that we took was that the machinery had replaced the real magic.
And that struck me so much.
Every time I felt a little bit more than <unk>
I would tell you this idea of losing the ability to enjoy and appreciating a sunset if I didn't have the camera, if I couldn't afford my friends.
It seemed to me that technology had to allow the magic, not <unk>
As a child, my grandfather gave me his <unk> silver <unk>
And this piece of technology was for my most magical thing.
It became a golden door to a world full of images, of <unk> and <unk> in my imagination.
I had the feeling that mobile phones -- the luxury clocks and the cameras prevent them from <unk>
<unk> our inspiration.
So I was <unk> I came up to this technological world to see how we use it to create magic, rather than <unk>
<unk> books since the 16 years.
So when I saw the iPad, I saw an <unk> device that can connect the readers of the whole world.
You can know how we took the book, and we can know how we take the book.
Where we are.
Put the text together with the image to animation, sound and touch.
<unk> becomes increasingly <unk>
But what do we do is that?
I'm about to launch <unk> an interactive application for the iPad.
He says, <unk> your fingers on each other.
And so ...  It says, "This box box belongs to <unk> I write my name.
And so I get a character from the book.
At various times I get a <unk> -- the iPad knows where I live because of the GPS -- that comes to me.
My inner girl got excited about all of these possibilities.
I've talked a lot about magic.
And I don't mean <unk> and <unk> but to that magic of childhood, and those ideas that I <unk>
For some reason, fireflies in a jar were always <unk>
So over here, we have to tilt the iPad to release fireflies.
And really, they shine your way into the way the East book.
Another idea that fascinated me was that a whole <unk> galaxy was a <unk>
So here, every book and every world becomes a <unk> that I move into this magic device inside the device.
And this opens up a map.
In all sorts of fantasy books, there's always been maps but have been static maps.
This is a map that grows, <unk> and guide you over the rest of the book.
In certain points of the book they also <unk>
Now I'm going to go in.
Another incredibly important aspect for me is to create Indian content and the contemporary of contemporary life.
These are the <unk>
We've all heard of <unk> and <unk> but how many people outside India know the <unk> <unk> <unk>
These poor <unk> have been trapped in the cameras of Indra for millennia, in an old and <unk> book.
So we're bringing them back into a <unk> child history.
In a story that deals with the current issues like the environmental crisis.
And talking about the environmental crisis, one of the problems of the last 10 years has been that children have been <unk> attached to their <unk> not from the outside world.
But now with mobile technology, we can bring our kids into the natural world with their technology.
One of the interactions of the book is this adventure that we have to go out and take the camera or iPad, and we collect images of different natural objects.
As a kid I had a lot of <unk> <unk> rocks, <unk> and <unk>
For some reason, children don't do it.
So to reclaim this childhood ritual you have to go out and in a chapter, and it was a shot of a flower and then <unk>
In another chapter, you have to take a picture of a piece of cortex and then <unk>
So you create a digital collection of pictures that then you can put on the Web.
A child in London puts a picture of a <unk> and he says, "Oh, I saw a <unk>
A kid in India says, "I saw a <unk>
And you create this kind of social network around a collection of digital pictures that have been taking.
Within the variants of the connection between magic, Earth and technology are many possibilities.
In the next book we asked to have an interaction where you come out with the iPad and the video on it, and you see a group of <unk> cartoons that appear on the inside of the house.
At a moment, the screen is full of leaves with leaves here.
And you have to make the sound of the wind and <unk> so you can read the rest of the book.
We're going to a world where the forces of nature are <unk> with technology and magic and technology closer to another.
<unk> the energy of the sun.
We're getting closer to our children and ourselves to the natural world and that magic, joy and love to sit through a simple story.
Thank you.
I'd like to talk to you about why many projects of <unk> <unk>
And I think, really, that the most important thing about that is we stop listening to patients.
And one of the things we did at the University of <unk> was <unk> to a <unk>
And not in a very scientific way, she raised a little cup of coffee or you and asked patients, family and <unk> What <unk>
How can we <unk>
And we tend to think that this is one of the biggest problems for what all of us, or maybe not all, but most of the <unk> projects, they fail to stop listening.
This is my Wi-Fi scale. It's a very simple thing.
It has a shirt on and <unk>
Every morning I <unk>
And yes, I have a challenge as you can see.
I put the challenge to 95 percent.
But it's so simple, that every time I put my information to Google <unk>
And my <unk> doctor has access to him as well. So he can see what my weight problem is -- not at the same time that you need <unk> or some urgency of that style -- but to look back.
But there's something else.
Like some of you know, I have more than 4,000 followers on Twitter.
So every morning I connect to my Wi-Fi scale and before you go up to my car, people start to <unk> <unk> today I think you need a <unk> lunch.
That's the best thing that can happen, because it's the pressure of the pairs used to help patients, because it could be used for obesity, and also for patients stop smoking.
On the other hand, can be <unk> to move people out of their chairs and together develop some <unk> activity to have more control of their health.
From the next week, it's going to be available from the next week.
This little <unk> connected to an iPhone or a little device.
And people <unk> from their homes, to take their pressure, <unk> to their doctor and share it with others, for example, for 100 dollars.
This is the point where patients assume a position, come back to reclaim control and to be captains of their own <unk> but it can also help us health care because of the challenges that we face as the firing of the costs of attention, <unk> <unk> and other issues.
<unk> techniques that are simple to use and start with this to engage patients in the team.
And you can do it with techniques like this, but also through <unk>
And one of the things we did I'd like to share with you with a video video.
We all have checks in <unk>
Maybe we even have them in our phones.
We know perfectly where ATM <unk> <unk>
But where are all the <unk>
And of course, we can find fast food.
But where's the nearest <unk> to help this patient?
We asked but no one <unk>
Nobody knew where to get the <unk> saves lives right now.
What we did was we do <unk> in the Netherlands.
We created a website, and we asked the audience <unk> you see a <unk> please say, <unk> where, when it's open, they sometimes open up in <unk> and others are closed.
And over 10,000 <unk> they already were introduced in the Netherlands.
The next step was to look for the application for that.
And we made an application for the iPad.
We created an app for <unk> reality to find these <unk>
And every time you're in the city of <unk> and somebody <unk> you can use your iPhone, and the next few weeks to use their phone phone <unk> to find the nearest <unk> which can save lives.
And from today, I'd like to present this one, not just like <unk> <unk> which is the name of the product, but as a <unk>
And we want them to <unk> globally.
We are <unk> all the colleagues in the world, in other universities, to help us find and work as a center for the <unk> of <unk> around the world.
Every time you're on vacation and somebody <unk> can be a relative or somebody in front of you, you can find it.
I'd also like to invite companies around the world that could help us <unk> these <unk>
They could be <unk> or <unk> people for example, to see if the <unk> which is shown is still in their place.
Please <unk> on this and not just improve health, but take control of it.
Thank you very much.
I'm here to share <unk> photography.
Or is it <unk> <unk>
Because, of course, it's photographs that can't take on their cameras.
My interest in photography was woke up with my first digital camera at 15 years.
He mixed with my previous passion for the drawing of it, but it was a little bit different because when I used the camera the process was in planning to him.
And when you take a photograph with a camera -- the process ends up when you press the <unk>
For me the photograph had more to do with being in the right place, at the right time.
It seemed like anybody could do it.
So I wanted to create something different, a process that would start by pressing the <unk>
<unk> like this: A building on a very <unk> road <unk>
But it has an unexpected twist on it.
And despite it, it keeps a level of <unk>
Or pictures like <unk> dark and colorful at the time, but with the common goal of keeping the <unk>
And when I say <unk> I mean <unk>
Because, of course, it's not something that I can do, but I always want it to have been captured in some way as photography.
<unk> where you have to think about a moment to discover the trick.
It's got more to be able to capture an idea that I have to capture a moment.
But what is the trick that makes it seem <unk>
It's the details or the <unk>
Take the light?
What does the <unk> mean?
Sometimes the illusion is your perspective.
But in the end, it's about our way to interpret the world and how you can perceive it on a <unk> surface.
It's actually not about whether it's realistic but what we think is <unk>
So I think the basics are very simple.
I see it as a puzzle of reality where we take different pieces of reality and put them together to create an alternative reality.
I'll show you a simple example.
Here we have three perfectly <unk> objects that we can all relate to three-dimensional world.
But combined in some ways you can create something that even seems to be <unk> as if it exists.
But, at the same time, we know that it doesn't exist.
So <unk> the brain because the brain doesn't embrace the fact that it doesn't really make sense.
And I see the same process by combining the pictures.
It's actually combining different realities.
And the things that make a picture look like realistic I think they're those ones that don't even understand the things that surround us in our daily lives.
But by combining photographs of it is very important to <unk> because otherwise something will look bad.
So I would like to say that there are three simple rules that are going to follow for realistic outcomes.
As you can see, these images are not very special.
But <unk> can create something like this.
So the first rule is that the combination of pictures must have the same perspective.
Second, the <unk> photos must have the same kind of light.
And these two images meet these <unk> were taken at the same height and the same kind of light.
The third point is to do impossible to distinguish the beginning and the end of the different images with perfect <unk>
It has to be impossible to see where the image.
This is another example.
You might think that this is an image of a landscape and the bottom is <unk>
But this image is completely composed of photographs of different places.
And I think it's easier to create a place that it might find out because you don't need to get in danger of the ideas that have in the head.
But it takes a lot of planning.
And as I thought about this idea in winter, I knew I had several months to <unk> to find the different locations for the pieces of the puzzle.
For example, the fish was captured on a fishing journey.
The shores are a different location.
The <unk> part was captured in a rock.
And yes, I even did a red house at the top of the island to look more <unk>
So to make a realistic outcome I think it takes planning.
You always start with a <unk> an idea.
Then we can combine the different pictures.
And here each piece is very well <unk>
If you do a good job when you take the pictures the result can be very beautiful, and at the very <unk>
All the tools are there and the only limit is our imagination.
Thank you.
I'll start showing you a slide on technology, very boring.
Please let me <unk>
It's a diagram anybody I took from a portfolio of mine.
I'm not very interested in showing you the details but the general shape.
This is a analysis that we were doing about the power of <unk> <unk> versus the power of local area.
The interesting thing about this is that this one, as a lot of other people we usually see, is a straight kind of a straight line on scale.
In other words, every step here represents an order of magnitude in the performance.
I'm going to talk about the technology with <unk> curves that is new.
Here's something strange.
And that's what I'm going to talk about.
Please turn on the lights.
It gets more intensity because writing on paper.
Why do we <unk> technology on <unk> <unk>
The answer is that if you draw it on a regular curve where, say, these are the years or a unit of time, and this would be any kind of technology that I'd like to show you, the diagram would look something ridiculous.
That would be something like this.
It doesn't say much.
But if you look for example, some other technology, like transportation, on a <unk> curve, it would be very dumb, we would see a straight line.
But if something like this, it gives you a <unk> change.
If the technology of transportation is as fast as the <unk> last morning we could take a taxi and be in Tokyo in 30 seconds.
But it doesn't go through that rhythm.
There is no <unk> in the history of technological development that every few years pass orders of magnitude.
The question I want to ask is -- looking at these <unk> <unk> we see it not forever.
It's not possible to sustain this fast change as it goes.
<unk> one of two things.
Or it's going to become a typical curve. I know like this until it comes to something completely different, or maybe I'll do something like that.
That's all that can happen.
I'm optimistic, so I think maybe something like this.
And so we would now be in the middle of a transition.
In this line we are in a transition from what used to be the world to a new way.
So what I try to ask, and ask me is, what is that new way that <unk> the world?
What new state is the world?
The transition seems very, very confused if we're engaged in it.
I remember that the future was happening in the year 2000 and people used to talk about what would happen in 2000.
This is a conference where people talk about the future and we see that the future is still 2000.
That's all we see.
In other words, the future has been <unk> year after year, throughout my life.
But I think it's because we feel something is going on.
It takes a transformation.
And we know that it doesn't have a lot of sense to think about 30 or 50 years because everything will be so different to extrapolate what we're doing today doesn't make any sense.
So I want to talk to you about how it might be, how could that transition that we <unk>
But to do that will have to talk a little bit about things that don't have much to do with technology and computer technology.
Because I think the only way to understand it is taking distance and looking at the long-term things.
The scale of time when I would like to do it is the time of life on Earth.
I think this image makes sense if we looked at it every billion years.
So we go back a couple of two billion years when the Earth was a huge <unk> rock, with a lot of chemicals that will <unk> around it.
If we look at the way that we organized those chemicals we give us an idea of how things were.
And I think there is theories to begin to understand the origin with RNA. I'm going to tell you a simple version of this and that is that, at that time, there was floating around with some oil <unk> with all kinds of chemical prescriptions inside it.
Some of those blobs of oil held a particular combination of chemicals that made them put out materials from the outside and the droplets grew up.
And they started <unk>
In a sense, those were the most <unk> cell shapes -- those <unk> oil.
But those blobs weren't alive in the current sense, because each one of them contained a random recipe of chemicals.
And every time they <unk> it <unk> a chemical distribution of the chemicals that we <unk>
So every <unk> was a little different.
In fact, the droplets of a way will be <unk> to be better at the time to bring the chemicals, <unk> more chemicals and get more <unk>
They usually lived longer, they were more <unk>
It was a form of life, a very simple chemical life, but things are interesting to be interesting when these droplets learned the trick of abstraction.
Somehow we don't really understand these <unk> they learned to store information.
They learned to hold information, which was the recipe for the cell -- in a special chemistry called DNA.
In other words, <unk> in this <unk> evolution, a writing system that allowed them to record what they were to be able to <unk>
The amazing thing is that that writing system seems to have remained stable since it evolved two billion years ago.
Our recipe, our genes, has exactly the same code, that same writing system.
In fact, each living living is expressed exactly the same set of letters and the same code.
And one of the things I did just by <unk> We can write things out of this code.
Here I have a hundred <unk> of white dust that I try to hide the other security <unk>
But <unk> Tom this <unk> The code has the common letters that we tend to use in this -- and I wrote my personal data on this piece of DNA and <unk> 10 to 22 times.
So if somebody wants to be 100 million copies of my personal card, I have a lot of <unk> in fact, for every single person in the world and it's here.
If it was a <unk> he would have put it in a virus and have spread around the room.
What was the next <unk>
Writing DNA was an interesting step.
This made these cells happy another billion years.
But then there was another big step in which things were <unk> very different and it was that these cells started exchanging and communicating information forming and to communicate information.
I don't know if you know, but bacteria can exchange DNA.
So for example, it evolved resistance to antibiotics.
Some bacteria found the way to avoid penicillin and <unk> them to create their small DNA with other bacteria and now there are many resistant to penicillin because bacteria are <unk>
This communication gave place to be formed in the communities that in a way, they were together in it, and set up a <unk>
It would be <unk> or <unk> together, or if a community was very successful all the individuals in that community more and more and they were <unk> by evolution.
And the point of turning it happened when these communities came back so much that, in fact, they came together and decided to write the whole recipe of the community together in a string of DNA.
The next interesting stage for life took another billion years.
And at that stage, we have communities in the communities of many different types of cells working together as a single organism.
In fact, we are a <unk> community.
We have many cells that don't work alone.
The skin skin doesn't serve with the heart or the muscle or the brain or so on.
So these communities evolved and become more interesting levels than the cell phone, which we call a organism.
The next level happened within these communities.
These started to <unk> information.
And to build very special structures that they didn't do more than processing information in community.
These are the <unk> structures.
The neurons are the devices that process the information that those cell cell communities built.
In fact, they started <unk> within the community being the responsible structures of <unk> understanding and convey information.
Those were the brains and the nervous system in those communities.
And that gave them an evolutionary advantage.
Because at that moment as <unk> learning was confined to the duration of an organism, not to the period of evolutionary time.
So a organism could say, for example, learn not to eat some fruit, because he knew sick and got sick the last time I ate it.
That could happen during the life of an organism because they had built these information processing structures that it would have learned for hundreds of thousands of years by the death of individuals who ate that fruit.
So the fact that the nervous system would build those structures from information that accelerated the evolutionary process.
Because evolution could now happen confined to an individual.
It could happen in the time necessary to learn.
But then, of course, the individuals discovered the <unk> trick.
So for example, the most <unk> version that we know is human language.
If we think about it, it's an incredible invention.
I have a very complicated idea, a <unk> idea.
I'm sitting here emitting some <unk> and hopefully building a similar idea, <unk> and <unk> in your heads that keeps some analogy with mine.
But we take something very complicated that we become sound, in sound, in sound, and we produce something very complicated in another brain.
That now allows us to start to work like a organism.
In fact, as humanity, we've begun to do <unk>
We now move through periods of similar periods of <unk> organisms.
For example, the invention of language was a little step in that direction.
<unk> computer <unk> <unk> <unk> and so on, are the specialized mechanisms that we now build to handle that information.
And that brings us together into something much larger, faster and capable of evolve than we did before.
Now evolution can happen at microseconds.
You saw the evolutionary evolutionary <unk> that produced some evolution with the <unk> program before our eyes.
And now we have accelerated time scales again.
The first stages of the story that was telling you brought up a billion years each.
The next stages, the nervous system and the brain, took a few hundred million years.
The <unk> and so on, they took less than a million years.
And those days, like electronics, it seems to take just a few decades.
The process is <unk> I guess <unk> is the right word to name something that accelerates its own pace of change.
The more changes, the faster it does.
And I think that's what we see in this explosion of the curve.
We see the process <unk>
But I make my life designing computers and I know that the mechanisms that I work for <unk> would not be possible without the advancements without the advances of recent technology.
But now design objects of such complexity that would be impossible for me in a conventional way.
I don't know that every transistor in that machine <unk>
There are billions.
Instead, with the designers of <unk> <unk> we think about a level of abstraction -- we put it into the machine and the machine that it does something that you couldn't do before you couldn't get much further and faster than ever before.
In fact, sometimes it's used methods that we don't even understand well.
A particularly interesting method I've been using lately, is evolution itself.
We put inside the machine an evolutionary process that operates on the scale of microseconds.
And for example, in the most extreme cases, we can evolve a program from a random sequence of instructions.
We say, "Please computer, you can run a hundred million <unk> <unk>
You could run these instructions of instructions at random, to run all these programs, and take those things that are <unk> what we want to do?"
In other words, I define what I want.
Let's say I want to <unk> numbers, to put a simple example.
So we found the programs that you get more to <unk>
Of course, it's unlikely to be some random sequences of instructions, <unk> numbers, so none of them got it.
But one, luckily, was able to find two numbers on the right order.
And I said, <unk> you could take 10 percent of those random sequences that best did the <unk>
They <unk> those and <unk> the rest of it.
And now we have the best <unk> the numbers.
And let's go back to <unk> following a process of <unk> analog to <unk>
Let's take two programs, that <unk> children, who <unk> <unk> and that the kids are providing the properties of both programs.
So we got a new generation of programs from the combinations of programs that had a little more success.
And we say, "Please <unk>
<unk> again.
We had some mutations <unk>
And it tries to go again and try and go back to another generation.
Well, every generation takes a few milliseconds.
So I can do the equivalent of millions of years of evolution in a few minutes, or in complex cases, in a few hours.
In the end, we end up with programs that are going to ask for numbers absolutely perfect.
In fact, they're much more efficient programs than I could have written by hand.
If I look at those programs I can't say how they work.
I've tried to look at them to see how they work.
These are dark programs, strangers.
But they get <unk>
In fact, I know, I have the security that you get the goal because they come from a bloodline of hundreds of thousands of programs that they did it.
In fact, their lives are dependent on it.
Once I was going on a 747 with <unk> <unk> and grabs a card and says, "Look at this.
It says, <unk> plane has hundreds of thousands of <unk> that work together to offer <unk> <unk> you don't make you feel <unk>
We know that engineering processes don't work very well when they become complicated.
So we started to depend on computers to do very different design processes.
And that allows us to produce much more complex things than produces normal engineering.
But we don't understand the whole choices that there is.
In that sense, it goes in front of us.
Now we use those programs to do a lot faster and so that we can run these programs much more quickly.
I mean, it <unk>
The thing goes faster and so I think it seems so <unk>
Because all of these technologies are <unk>
We are <unk>
And we are at an analog to the analog of organisms that became <unk>
We are <unk> and we can't understand what the hell we're creating.
We're at the tipping point.
But I think something comes behind us.
I think it would be very arrogant from our part to think that we are the final product of evolution.
And I think that all of us are part of creating whatever it is to come.
But now comes the lunch and I think we stop here before I <unk>
I think we have to do something with a part of the medical culture that has to change.
And I think this starts with a doctor, and that's me.
And I've spent time enough to let me give up part of my false <unk> in that.
Before I treat the theme of my talk, let's talk a little bit of baseball.
Why not?
We're near the end of the end of the World <unk>
We love baseball, right?
The baseball is full of amazing statistics.
There are hundreds of statistics.
It's going to be <unk> <unk> talks about statistics and using them to form a big baseball team.
I'm going to focus on one of them and I hope many of you have heard of it.
It's called the average <unk>
And we talked about 300 percent of a <unk> which was going to be <unk>
That means the <unk> bat <unk> three of 10 times.
That means to launch the ball to the game field without being <unk> and anyone who tried to <unk> the first base, not to come to time, and the second base will be <unk>
Three <unk>
You know how they call a <unk> <unk> in the Grand <unk>
Well, really well, maybe the team of stars.
You know how they call a baseball <unk>
By the way, that's somebody who 10 <unk> hit four.
<unk> like the legendary Ted Williams, the last player in the Women's League of <unk> in doing more 400 strokes in a regular season.
Now I put this to my world of medicine where I feel much more comfortable or maybe less uncomfortable, after what I'm going to tell you today.
Suppose you have <unk> and they are <unk> a surgeon who has a <unk> record to <unk>
It doesn't work, right?
Now suppose that they live in a place and a dear being, has two <unk> <unk> and their family <unk> attached to a cardiologist whose record <unk>
But know what?
She's doing a lot of <unk>
And their hits have been <unk>
This is not working.
But I'll ask you to ask:
What do you think you should be the average of hits a heart or heart surgeon or a nurse <unk>
<unk> very good.
And the truth of the issue is that nobody in any medicine knows the hits of a good surgeon, a doctor or a <unk>
What we do, though, is send them to the world, and I include myself to be perfect.
That never, ever make a mistake and try to figure out how to do it well.
That was the message that <unk> when I was in medical school.
I was a obsessional student <unk>
Once, a fellow in high school said that Brian Goldman <unk> a blood <unk>
<unk>
<unk> in my little <unk> in the <unk> <unk> hospital at General <unk> not far from here.
And I learned all of the memory.
From my kind of anatomy, <unk> the origin and the <unk> the <unk> of every artery that comes out of <unk> the frequent diagnosis and <unk>
And even knew the differential diagnosis -- about how we classify <unk> <unk> <unk>
And as much more knowledge.
And I was very well; I graduated from <unk>
And <unk> from medical school with the impression that if you take everything, then you would know everything, or as possible as it would know everything, because so I get rid of the mistakes.
And it worked for a while, until I met Mrs. <unk>
I was a resident in a university hospital in Toronto, when they brought the woman to the emergency room where I worked.
I was assigned to the service of <unk>
And when I applied to a cardiologist to a cardiologist -- I was going to attend that patient.
And they reported to the chief of residents.
When I saw Mrs. <unk> was <unk>
I heard a <unk> sound.
And when the <unk> I heard a <unk> sound on both sides, which <unk> a heart failure.
In these conditions the heart stops working and instead of pump your blood forward, the blood goes to your lungs, these are <unk> and that's why there's difficulty breathing.
And it wasn't hard to <unk>
I did it and I went to work on the treatment of the treatment that I <unk>
I gave him <unk> and medication to alleviate the pressure in your heart.
I gave him <unk> <unk> and water pills so that it could eliminate liquid.
And in an hour or two, she started feeling better.
And I felt great.
And that's when I made the first <unk> he sent her home.
I really made two more mistakes.
He sent her home without talking to the chief of <unk>
I didn't get the phone and I did what I should have done, that I was calling my boss, and he <unk> with him for the <unk>
And if my boss had seen, would have been able to bring <unk> information.
Maybe I did it for a good reason.
Maybe I didn't want to be a resident to get a constant attention.
Maybe I wanted to be so successful and capable of taking care of my patients without even contact my boss.
The second mistake I made was worse.
And he sent her to his house, he had no attention to a voice on my inside that he was like, <unk> is not a good idea. Don't do it.
In fact, I was so unsure that I asked the nurse that he <unk> the lady <unk> "Do you think it's okay if you go to his <unk>
And the nurse thought, and then he said, "Yes, I think that's right."
I remember that as if it were yesterday.
And so he was signed up the <unk> and the ambulance together with the <unk> her home.
And I went back to the hospital.
The rest of that day, that afternoon, I had a bad <unk> in the stomach.
But I followed my job.
At the end of the day, I <unk> to leave the hospital and I walked into the parking lot where my car was to go home. And at that time, I did something I don't do normally, for that time.
I went through the emergency emergency service to home.
And there is another nurse, not the <unk> of Mrs. <unk> before, but another one told me three words, those three words that most emergency doctors are <unk>
Other specialists fear it also, but there's a <unk> in <unk> and we see the patients <unk>
The three words are: <unk>
<unk> the patient who sent her <unk>
I asked the other <unk> nurse, <unk>
And then she <unk> with the same tone of voice.
She was fine.
But I went back and on the brink of death.
At the end of an hour of having come to his house, after I gave him a high school and she had a collapse and his family called the <unk> the <unk> the <unk> the <unk> the <unk> in a <unk> blood pressure of <unk> meaning a shock severe.
I just didn't breathe and I was blue.
The emergency staff <unk> all their resources.
They gave him medication to raise blood pressure.
And they put an artificial <unk>
I was <unk> and <unk> to the core.
He had a mixture of feelings because after the <unk> was in intensive care and hoped against all the hope that he <unk>
And in the two or three days later, it was obvious that I never <unk>
It had a brain damage.
The family got gathered together.
And in eight or nine days, they were <unk> to what was happening.
And the ninth day, the left left to go. <unk> wife, mother and grandmother.
They say they never forget the names that they die.
That was my first experience.
The weeks later, I was <unk> for it and experienced for the first time the shame <unk> that exists in our medical culture, and I felt lonely, <unk> without feeling that healthy shame because you can't engage with your colleagues.
You make peace and never make that mistake.
It's that shame that leaves teaching.
<unk> shame that I talk about is that makes us feel very bad inside.
It's the one that tells us that what we did was that what we did is that we are bad.
And that felt.
And it wasn't by my <unk> he was a <unk>
I talked to the family, and I'm sure to <unk> things and made sure that I didn't care about it.
And I kept going.
Why didn't I ask my <unk> Why did he send him home?
And in my worst <unk> Why did I made such a <unk> <unk>
Why did I choose medicine?
Little to that feeling was <unk>
And I began to feel better.
And on one day I was opened up the sky, and finally came out the sun and wondering if I would feel better again.
And I made a deal with me in which if we were to <unk> the efforts to be perfect for not making more mistakes, I would make those voices.
And he did.
I went back to work.
But it turned back to happen.
Two years later, I was an expert in the emergency room in a community hospital in northern Toronto, and I got a <unk> man with a pain in <unk>
I was very busy and <unk>
And he pointed out here.
I looked into his throat, I was kind of <unk>
He was <unk> penicillin and sent him home.
But while he ran to the door followed his <unk>
Two days later, when I came to do my <unk> my head was asked to talk to me <unk> in his office.
And I gave the three words: <unk>
Remember the patient who saw for a pain in <unk>
Well, he came back and I didn't have a <unk> <unk>
It had a potentially deadly condition called <unk>
You can search for Google. It's an infection, not from the throat, but from the upper area, and that it can cause the close to those tracks.
He, fortunately, did not die.
It was <unk> antibiotics on <unk> and <unk>
And I went through the same period of shame and <unk> then I went back to work, and I went back to work, until it happened again and again and again.
Two times in the same <unk> <unk> not <unk> <unk>
And it's a great effort, especially working in a hospital, because it was <unk> to 14 patients at the same time.
But in both cases, I didn't send them home, and I don't think it's been a <unk>
One of them thought he had a <unk> calculation of it.
<unk> an X-ray of kidneys but it turned out, a colleague that was checking the patient -- a certain sensitivity in the bottom right-hand corner, and he called the surgeon.
The other patient was with a lot of diarrhea.
And I read a liquid order for <unk> and I asked my colleague who <unk> it.
I checked it and noticed in some sensitivity in the lower right-hand corner, called the surgeon <unk>
Both were operated and recovered well <unk>
But every single case, I was <unk>
But I'd like to tell you that I made the worst mistakes in the first five years of exercise, and as many colleagues say, it's a <unk>
The most meaningful ones have been for the last five years.
<unk> embarrassed and support.
And here's the problem: If I can't get it back and talk about my mistakes, if I can't find the <unk> that tells me what happened, how can I share this with my <unk>
How do I show you this so that they don't make the same <unk>
If I could go to a place like this, I wouldn't have any idea what you think of me.
When was the last time you heard somebody talk about failure, after failure, after failure?
Of course in a party, you will hear about the errors in other doctors, but you won't hear somebody talking about their own mistakes.
And if I knew and my colleagues also, that a <unk> in my hospital <unk> the wrong leg -- trust me I would have difficulty looking at the eyes.
This is the system that we have.
The total denial of mistakes.
It's the system where there are two <unk> the ones that make mistakes and the ones that will not sleep and the ones that I know; the ones that have <unk> outcomes and those who have great outcomes.
And it's almost like an antibody reaction, as antibodies that start to attack that person.
We have the idea that if you get from medicine to the people who make mistakes, we will get a safe system.
But that brings two problems.
In 20 years of <unk> and journalism, I've made a personal study for bad doctor and medical failures to learn as possible, from the first paper that I wrote for the Toronto, <unk> Black <unk> <unk> Black <unk> <unk> Black <unk>
And what I learned is that errors are <unk>
We worked in a system where errors are happening every single day, where one in 10 drugs are <unk> in the hospital are wrong, or <unk> is not correct. In a system where <unk> infections are increasingly <unk> by making chaos and death.
In this country, 80,000 Canadian die for errors <unk>
The American Institute of Medicine established 100,000.
In both cases, it's about <unk> <unk> because we're not <unk> the problem as we should.
And that's what things are.
A <unk> system where knowledge is added every two or three years, and we don't <unk>
<unk> sleep <unk>
And we can't get rid of it.
We have cognitive biases that allow you to make a perfect history of a patient with chest pain.
Now, let's take the same patient with a chest pain in my chest, and I come to stick with <unk> and I just stand to alcohol and, suddenly, my story <unk> from contempt.
It's not the same story.
I'm not a <unk> I don't do things the same.
And my patients are not cars. Don't <unk> their symptoms always in the same way.
All of this, mistakes are inevitable.
So if we take the system like we are <unk> and we eliminate all the professionals -- you may not be any of any of the professionals -- well, you won't get no one.
And with respect to that people don't want to talk about their most <unk>
In my <unk> <unk> <unk> art.
And their students were <unk> to go down to slow down their head and <unk> saliva and start telling their stories.
They want to tell their stories, they want to share them.
<unk> to say, "Look, don't make the same <unk>
They need a context where we can do it.
They need a <unk> medical culture.
And it starts with a doctor every time.
The <unk> physician is human, you know, the human knows it, and they are not proud of your mistakes, but it tries to learn from what happened to teach others.
They <unk> their experiences with them.
It's support for those who talk about their mistakes.
They <unk> the errors of other people who are not intended to <unk> but in a loving way and support for everybody to <unk>
And it works in a medical culture that recognizes that human beings run the system, and when this happens, they make errors in a time.
My name is Brian <unk>
I'm a <unk> doctor.
I'm a human, I will make errors again.
And I feel so much but I am effort to learn something that can convey to others.
I don't know what to me, but I can live with that.
And let me conclude with three words: I remember it.
Do you know how many decisions we take <unk>
Do you know how much we choose in a week?
And I recently made a survey over 2,000 people and the average amount of election that says to pick up an average American -- are about 70 a day.
Not long ago in a research week followed by a week to a group of presidents of businesses.
The researchers recorded the different tasks that are <unk> by these CEOs and the time that we were trying to make decisions about those tasks.
They found that on average, <unk> <unk> jobs a week.
Naturally, every work included lots of <unk>
Half of those decisions took nine minutes or less.
Just 12 percent required an hour or more than their time.
Now think about your elections.
You know how many people belong to the <unk> category and how many of an hour?
How are the <unk> how it deals with those decisions?
Today I want to talk about one of the biggest problems of <unk> to choose to <unk>
I want to talk about the problem and about possible solutions.
As I talk about this, I'm going to ask you a few questions and I need to know about your answers.
When I ask a question, like I'm blind, raise your hand just if you want to burn calories.
Otherwise when you ask a question, if your answer is positive please give you a <unk>
And now my first question: Are you ready to hear about the problem of <unk> <unk>
Thank you.
Being a graduate student at the University of Stanford, <unk> this very, very <unk> <unk> at least at that time was very sophisticated.
His name was <unk>
It was almost like going to a <unk> park.
There was like 250 different kinds of mustard and <unk> over 500 different kinds of fruits and vegetables and about 25 of the <unk> water, and this was when we were growing water from the tap.
I loved going to that store, but on one occasion, I asked me, why never I buy nothing?
This is the shelf for <unk> oil.
They had more than 75 different classes, including those who were in <unk> box that came from trees <unk>
I once decided to visit the manager and ask her, <unk> this strategy to offer all these <unk>
He pointed to me full <unk> <unk> that came every day, usually with their cameras.
We decided to do a little experiment with the <unk> This is the <unk>
<unk>
They had <unk> different classes.
And I put a post to <unk> right to the shop.
We put up there from six <unk> or 24 flavors and we looked at two things: First of all, what case people were willing to stop testing the <unk>
More people stopped when he had <unk> an expenditure that when I had only six six, 40 percent.
We also looked at what case they were more likely to buy a jar of <unk>
Here's the opposite effect.
What stopped when there were only three percent left to buy <unk>
What stood when I had six, we saw that 30 percent bought <unk>
If we do the calculations, people were six times more likely to buy <unk> if they were six.
Well, deciding that we don't buy <unk> we probably will be <unk> -- less is good to keep the <unk> but it turns out that the problem of the delivery of choices are affecting us very well <unk> decisions.
We decided to not decide, even when we don't get <unk>
Now the theme of the day, the financial savings.
I'm going to describe to you a study that I did with <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> where we look at the savings decisions for about a million Americans, from a million Americans, from this country.
We were interested in looking at if the number of funds were available for savings plans for retirement plans for <unk> <unk> to people saving for the future.
And we found that I really know there was a <unk>
We had <unk> plans that went from two, to 59 choices.
We found that the biggest age of <unk> there were fewer participation.
So if we look at the extremes, we see that in the plans that they offer two funds, the rate of participation was from 70 or more, not as high as they wanted to.
And in the plans to offer about 60 funds, the rate of participation came to the '60s.
It turns out that even if you decide to participate, when there's more choices, even in that case, there's negative consequences.
So for those that they decided to participate, the more the number of choices, more people were <unk> to avoid actions or hedge funds.
As soon as there was more choices, they were more willing to invest in financial financial accounts.
But none of these extreme decisions are the ones that we are trying to optimize the future financial well-being.
In the previous decade, we've seen three main negative consequences to offer more and more possibilities.
The most likely thing is that we <unk> the decision, even when it goes against against the self-interest.
They're more likely to take the worst decisions.
They're more likely to pick things less <unk> even if you objectively it better.
The main reason is that we can look at that wide range of <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> but we're not able to do the calculations for interacting with and to choose that awesome <unk>
Today, I want to give you four simple techniques that we have <unk> in one form or another, in different research, so they can test in their businesses.
The first is, <unk>
You've heard it before, but it's never been even more true than today, which less is more.
People always mind when I say, <unk>
They care about losing space in <unk>
But actually, what we're seeing more and more is that if you decides to cut, get rid of strange <unk> options, there'll be an increase in sales, <unk> the costs, there'll be better experience in the election.
When <unk> & <unk> went from 26 different types of <unk> & <unk> 15, saw a 10 percent increase in sales.
When the Golden <unk> <unk> eliminated the products for <unk> of cats that fewer <unk> increased <unk> in <unk> by two <unk> higher sales and cost costs.
You know that today's supermarkets. There are 45,000 products.
In a tent, there's about 100,000 products.
But the ninth largest store in the world today is <unk> and it offers only 1,400 <unk> a kind of tomato sauce <unk>
In the public savings, I think one of the best examples that have come up on how to handle the choices is David <unk> the <unk> of Harvard.
All the Harvard employees are <unk> automatically from a safe background of life.
The people who really want to choose -- they give them 20 funds, not 300 or more.
You know, they often know people say, "I don't know how to <unk>
All of these are <unk> choices.
The first thing I do is ask the <unk> the differences that are among those options.
And if your employees can't <unk> they can't do their <unk>
This afternoon, before I started this session, I was talking to <unk>
He told me that he would be willing to offer people in this audience on a vacation with everything paid to the most beautiful road in the world.
Here, a <unk>
I want you to read it.
I'm going to leave you a few seconds to <unk> and then I want you to give a round of applause if you're ready to take the <unk>
<unk> <unk> OK. Anyone who's ready to accept the deal.
You're not more?
Well, I'm going to show you something else.
You knew there was a <unk>
Who is ready for that <unk>
I think I really hit the more hands.
All right.
Actually, you had more information on the first round, than at the second trial, but I can tell you that they thought the second time was more real.
Because the images made it more real.
This brings me to the second technique to handle the <unk> problem.
For people to understand the differences between choices, they have to understand the consequences of each option, and that the consequences must feel very very <unk>
Why is it why people spend 15 percent more on average, when they use debit cards or credit cards that when it uses <unk>
Because it doesn't look real money.
It turns out to make it look more real, it can be a very positive tool so that people are getting more.
We did a study with <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> on <unk> <unk> who worked in <unk> these people were in a meeting where they were <unk> to a <unk> plan.
At that meeting that we were <unk> exactly like <unk> did a little <unk>
What we added was that I would tell the staff to think about the positive things that you would think about in their lives if they were saving more money.
With this <unk> there was an increase in 20 percent and an increase in the number that they were interested in saving or what they wanted to put in their <unk> accounts.
The third technique is <unk>
We can handle more categories than options.
For example, this is a study that we did in a <unk>
We saw that in the supermarket supermarket along the <unk> <unk> the magazines show can contain from <unk> different types to <unk>
But you know?
Because the <unk> tells me how to <unk>
These are two <unk> exhibitions here.
One is called <unk> and another, <unk>
If you think the one on the left is <unk> and the one on the right is <unk> Give you a <unk>
<unk>
If you think the one on the left is <unk> and the one on the right is <unk> Give you a <unk>
Well, something else.
It turns out it's right.
The one on the left is <unk> and the one on the right is <unk> But you know what?
This rating framework is absolutely useless.
So the categories must indicate something that they are going to do is not when they were <unk>
You often see this problem with those huge lists of funding.
I suppose who are <unk>
My fourth <unk> <unk> complexity.
It turns out that we can handle a lot more information than we think, if we just <unk> it a little bit.
We have to increase the complexity.
I'm going to show you an example of what I mean.
So let's look at a very <unk> decision, the purchase of a car.
This is a German German manufacturer that allows them to <unk> completely.
You have to take 60 decisions, to build your car.
And these decisions vary in the number of choices that offers each one.
<unk> outside of the car. I have 56 possibilities.
<unk> box <unk> four options.
What I'm going to do is you change the order in which the decisions.
So half of the clients are going to go from a lot of choices, 56 colors, like a few ages, four boxes.
The other half of clients will go from a few choices, four <unk> to 56 colors, a lot of options.
And what am I going to <unk>
How involved you are.
If you <unk> the default button in every decision, this indicates that you're <unk> or <unk> we're <unk>
We found that the ones that go from a lot of choices to <unk> <unk> the <unk> button and again and another one.
The <unk>
If you go from a few choices to many, they continue there.
The same information, the same number of options.
The only thing I did was disrupt the order of the information.
If we start with how easy you learn to <unk>
Even though you pick the box of change does not say anything about the preferences of <unk> <unk> in all ways we made it to choose.
We are excited about a product that we're building that now has more <unk> with the process.
To wrap up.
I've talked about four techniques to mitigate the problem of <unk> <unk> <unk> alternate alternatives -- <unk> <unk> we can handle more categories of less <unk> <unk> complexity.
All these techniques that I've been presented were designed to help manage the <unk> or better for you, to use them in their business, or for people who will work.
It's that I think the key to getting the best of choice is being careful by <unk>
And the more careful in our choices will be able to practice the art of choice.
Thank you very much.
In the <unk> years, in East Germany -- if you had a typewriter to write to the government.
And I had to record a piece of text of text that was written with the machine.
And this is why the government could track the origin of the texts.
If they found one written with the wrong message you could track the footprint up to the origin of the idea.
In the West we don't think that somebody could do this, how much that we can do is the freedom of expression.
We would never do that in our countries.
But today, in 2011, if you buy a laser color printer in any big manufacturer and print one page, that page will end by having a little bit of yellow dots on each page that follow a pattern that makes them bare and your printer.
That's happening to us today.
And no one seems to be <unk> so much for this.
This is an example of the ways that our governments use technology against us, citizens.
And it's one of the top three main causes of problems in the network.
If we look at what happens in the world online we can put together the attacks on their <unk>
There are three main groups.
Are you the <unk>
Like Mr. <unk> <unk> from the city of <unk> in Ukraine.
Your <unk> mobile phone is very easy to understand.
These guys make money.
They use <unk> to earn a lot of money, large amounts.
There are really many cases of <unk> online, <unk> that were <unk> money with their attacks.
This is <unk> <unk> of <unk> <unk>
This is Alfred <unk>
This is Stephen <unk>
This is <unk> <unk>
These are Matthew <unk> <unk> and so on, etc., etc.
These guys make their online <unk> online, but they do it by illegal means by <unk> banking to steal money from our accounts when we buy <unk> or steal our keys to get information from our cards when we bought in a <unk> computer.
The secret service, two months ago, <unk> the Swiss account of this guy, Sam <unk> and this account had <unk> million dollars when it was frozen.
Mr. <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
And I say that today is more likely to be a victim of a <unk> than a real crime.
And it's very obvious that this is going wrong in worse.
In the future, most online crime?
The second group of <unk> in importance that we see today is not driven by money.
There is another thing that moves, they ask them the protests, they motivate them to motivate them laughter.
<unk> like Anonymous have <unk> in the last 12 months occupying a major role in the line.
Those are the three main <unk> the criminals who do it for money, the <unk> as Anonymous that makes it to protest and the last group are the national United States governments that we <unk>
And then we see cases like <unk>
That's a good example of government attack against its own citizens.
<unk> is an authority from the Netherlands or actually, it was.
They <unk> that last fall fall because of a <unk>
You will take the security of the site and put a <unk>
Last week, I said, in a meeting with the Dutch government, I asked one of the leaders if they <unk> <unk> death of people to <unk>
And the answer of him was yes.
So how are people dying because of an attack of these?
<unk> is an authority <unk>
<unk> <unk>
What does the <unk> serve <unk>
Well, you need if you have a website with <unk> services, <unk> services like <unk>
Except that <unk> a foreign authority.
And they sent <unk>
And in the case of <unk> it happened exactly that.
And what happened in the Arab Spring and those things that have happened, for example, in <unk>
Well, in Egypt the protesters <unk> the <unk> <unk> headquarters and during the <unk> of the building, they found a lot of papers.
Among those papers was this folder called <unk>
And within that folder there was notes of a company based on Germany that had sold the Egyptian government tools to intercept the communication of the citizens of the country.
They had sold this tool for 280 euros to the <unk> government.
The company headquarters is right here.
I mean, Western governments provide the tools to governments and governments to do this to their citizens.
But Western governments are also doing this to themselves.
For example, in Germany, just a couple of weeks ago, I found <unk> <unk> a <unk> used by the German government to investigate their own citizens.
If you're suspicious in a criminal case, you know, it's pretty obvious that your phone is <unk>
But today it's more there.
The connection to the Internet.
<unk> even tools like <unk> <unk> to infect our computer with a <unk> to allow them to see all communication, and listen to the discussions online, to get our data.
When we think closely about things like these the obvious answers that we should say, "Well, it looks a bad thing, but it doesn't really affect me because I'm an honest citizen.
Why <unk>
I have nothing to <unk>
And that argument doesn't make sense.
It's in play.
Privacy is not <unk>
It's not a matter of privacy against safety.
It's about freedom against control.
If we could rely on our governments today in 2011, any right that we have today, it will be forever.
<unk> blindly in any future government, in a management that we could have within 50 years?
These are the questions that have to worry about the next 50 years.
This is where I live. I live in Kenya, in the southern part of Nairobi.
These are the cows of my dad, in the background, and behind the cows, the National Park in Nairobi.
The National Park Park.
And predators, like the lions, they follow them, and this is what they do.
<unk> our cattle.
This is one of the people who killed at night, and as soon as we wake up in the morning and we found dead dead to me because it was the only <unk> we had.
My community, the <unk> we think we came from the sky with our animals and all the land to <unk> and so we value them.
So I grew up <unk> a lot of lions.
They were dying are warriors who protect our community and won, and they're also mad about the problem.
So they kill lions.
This is one of the six lions that killed in Nairobi.
I think that's why there is so few in the National Park in Nairobi.
A child in my community, at age six, is responsible for cattle.
So I had to find a way to fix this problem.
My first idea was to use fire, because I thought lions were scary.
But I realized that this is actually not <unk> because even helping lions to see the pen <unk>
I didn't get <unk>
A second idea was to use a <unk>
She was trying to trick lions so they believed that he was near the <unk>
But lions are very smart.  They came the first day and watched the <unk> and they were, but the second day, they came back and said, this thing doesn't move, it's always here.  So jumped and killed animals.
So one night I was walking around the pen with a torch and that day lions didn't come back.
I found that lions are afraid of the light that moves.
So I had an idea.
And I got a switch that he turned on and turned out the lights.
And this is a little lamp of a <unk> <unk>
<unk> everything.
As you can see, the solar cell load the battery and battery <unk> the electricity to the small box <unk> I call it a transformational.
And the <unk> box makes the lights up.
As you can see, the <unk> go out there, because that's where the lions.
And that's how you see the lions come at night.
The lights and <unk> and <unk> them to think that I'm walking through the <unk> but I'm sleeping in my bed.
Thank you.
So I put them in my house two years ago and since then, we never went to have a problem with lions.
And the houses of the neighborhood, you heard the idea.
One of them is from this grandmother.
She had killed many animals the lions and asked me if I could put the lights.
I said yes.
The <unk> You can see in the background, these are the lights for lions.
Since then, I've put them in seven houses in my community, and they're serving a lot.
And my idea is also used now for all Kenya, to scare other predators like <unk> <unk> and it's also using for <unk> elephants of farms.
Thanks to this invention, I was fortunate enough to get a fellowship at one of the best schools of Kenya, <unk> International School, and I'm very excited.
My new school is now helping raise funding and <unk>
I even took my friends to my community and we set up the lights in the houses that they don't have, and show them how to <unk>
So a year ago, I was just a kid in the meadows of the savanna <unk> the cows of my father, and he used to see planes fly, and I was saying that one day would be within one.
And here I am.
I got the opportunity to come in plane for the first time to TED.
My great dream is to get to the engineer and a pilot when I grow up.
I used to hate the lions, but now as my invention is saving my father and lions, we can be with lions without a conflict.
<unk> <unk> What in my language means, thank you very much.
Chris Anderson: You don't picture how exciting it is to hear a story like yours.
So you've got a scholarship. Richard <unk> Yes.
CA: You're working on other electrical <unk>
What's the next in your list?
<unk> My next invention is -- I want to do a near electric <unk>
<unk> I know you have invented electric fences -- but I want to do my own.
CA: You know, I just read it one time, <unk> and <unk> <unk> I've tried it before, but I stopped because I got a <unk>  CA: At the foot, Richard <unk> you're a big thing.
We go to <unk> at every single step that I have a friend of mine.
Thank you very much. <unk> Thank you.
When I was a little, I thought my country was the best on the planet.
And I grew up singing a song called <unk> <unk>
And I felt so proud.
In school, we would spend all the time studying the story of Kim <unk> but we never learned a lot about the rest of the world, except that America, South Korea, Japan are the enemies.
Even though I was wondering about the rest of the world, I thought I would spend my whole life in North Korea, until everything changed suddenly.
When I was seven years old, I saw my first public performance.
But I thought my life in North Korea was normal.
My family wasn't poor and I had never been hungry.
But one day, in 1995, my mom brought home a letter from my sister.
That said, "When I <unk> the five family members of the family will stop sitting in this world, because we haven't eaten in the two weeks.
We are <unk> together on the floor, and our bodies are so weak, we are ready to die."
He was very altered.
I was the first time I heard people were suffering in my country.
<unk> when I was walking in front of the train station, I saw something terrible that I can't erase my memory.
A woman without life was dead in the street, holding a child <unk> in his arms staring at his face of her mother without able to do anything.
No one <unk> because they were very concerned about taking care of them and their families.
A huge famine, <unk> <unk> North Korea in the <unk>
In the end, over a million North Koreans died during famine and only few of them survive <unk> insects and <unk>
They also became more and more <unk> the energy, everything around me was fully dark at night except for the sea lights in China, just crossing the river from my house.
I always wondered why they had light and we don't.
This is a picture of North Korea at night compared to countries compared to countries.
This is the <unk> River, which is <unk> between North Korea and China.
As you can see, the river can be very <unk> in certain points, allowing North Koreans to cross <unk>
But many of you die.
Sometimes I saw bodies floating around the river, sometimes.
I can't tell you the details of how I left North Korea, but I can only say that during the years of famine I was sent to China to live with <unk> family.
But I just thought I'd be separated from my family for short time.
I could never have imagined that I would take 14 years back together.
In China, it was hard to live as a young woman without my family.
I had no idea what life would be like <unk>
But I quickly learned that it's not just extremely difficult, but it's also dangerous, because the refugees North Koreans were considered illegal <unk>
So I was living with a constant fear that my identity was <unk> and it would be <unk> to a horrible <unk> back in North Korea.
One day, my worst nightmare became reality, when I was arrested by the Chinese police and <unk> at the police station.
Somebody was accused of being <unk> then I <unk> my skills in the Chinese language, and they asked me a lot of questions.
I was <unk>
I thought my heart was going to exploit.
If it didn't seem natural, it could be incarcerated and <unk>
I thought my life was going to end.
But I managed to control my emotions and answered the questions.
At the end of the <unk> a officer said to another, "This was a <unk> <unk> She's not <unk>
And they let me go. It was a miracle.
Some North Koreans are looking for asylum <unk>
But many people can be arrested for Chinese police and <unk>
These women were very lucky.
Even though cows were eventually released after a harsh international pressure.
These North Koreans were not so lucky.
Every year, countless North Koreans are captured in China and <unk> to North Korea, where they're <unk> <unk> or executed in public.
Even though I was lucky to fight many other North Koreans have not been so lucky.
It's tragic that North Koreans have to hide their identities and fight so hard to survive.
Even after you learn a new language and find work, everybody can take it in a second.
That's why, after 10 years of to hide my identity, I decided to rise to South Korea.
And I started a new life again.
<unk> in South Korea was a much greater challenge than I expected to.
The English was very important in South Korea, I had to start learning my third language.
Also, I understood that there was a huge gap between North and south.
We're all <unk> but inside, we have become very different from 67 percent of <unk>
I even went through an identity.
I'm a <unk> or <unk>
Where am I? Who am I?
Suddenly there was no country I could call with pride <unk>
Even though I went to the life in South Korea wasn't easy, I did a plan. I started to study for the income exam to college.
Just when I was starting to <unk> my new life, I got an alarming call.
The authorities in North Korea had a little bit of money that sent my family, and as punishment is my family going to be shifted to the force to a separate location in the <unk>
They had to run away immediately.
So I began to plan how to help them escape.
North Koreans have to travel long distances on the road to freedom.
It's almost impossible to cross the border between North Korea and South Korea.
So, ironically, I took a flight to China and went to the border of North Korea.
Because my family couldn't speak Chinese, I had to <unk> it somehow, for over 3,000 kilometers across China and then through Southeast Asia.
The journey in <unk> took a week, and we almost were caught several times.
Once, our bus was stopped and <unk> by an official police officer.
And he was asked to ask you all the way to ask you questions.
As my family couldn't understand Chinese, I thought my family was going to be arrested.
When the Chinese officer came up to my family, <unk> I stood up and told me that they were <unk> people who was <unk>
I looked at me <unk> but fortunately, I believed it.
We did all the way up to the border of <unk>
But I had to spend almost all my money to bribe <unk> guards, in <unk>
But even after the border, my family was arrested and incarcerated to cross the border <unk>
After paying <unk> and bribes, my family was liberated in a month.
But the time, my family was arrested and incarcerated again in the capital of <unk>
This was one of the lowest points in my life.
I did everything to liberate my family, and we were so close, but my family was <unk> in prison to prison to the embassy of South Korea.
I was going to come between the emergency office and the police station, desperately trying to liberate my family.
But I didn't have enough money to pay more bribes or <unk>
I lost hope.
At that moment, or the voice of a bad man, "What's the problem?"
I was so surprised that one stranger would mind asking.
With my poor English and a dictionary, I explained the situation, and without <unk> the man went to the <unk> <unk> and gave me the rest of the money for my family and to get them out of prison.
I <unk> it with all my heart, and I asked him, "Why do I <unk>
"I'm not <unk> he said.
"I'm helping the village <unk>
I realized that this was a symbolic moment in my life.
The kind unknown, a new hope for me and for the <unk> village, when I was <unk>
And I showed me that the goodness of strangers and the support of the international community are really the rays of hope that the village <unk> needs.
Over time, after our long journey, my family and I met in South Korea.
But achieving its freedom is only half the battle.
Many North Koreans are separated from their families and when they <unk> a new country, they start with a little bit of money.
So we can benefit from the international community to education, practice in the English community language, and more.
We can also act as a bridge between people in North Korea and the rest of the world.
Because a lot of us continue in contact with family <unk> and we send information and money that is helping to change North Korea.
I've been very <unk> I've got a lot of help and inspiration in my life, so I want to help North Koreans an opportunity to thrive with international support.
I'm sure you're going to see more and more North Koreans all over the world, including on the TED stage.
Thank you.
I live in the south.
This is <unk> <unk> stores of <unk> <unk> <unk>
So the city planners come together, and they thought, we're going to change the name of South Trade to represent something else, so they changed the middle Los Angeles -- as if this <unk> what's actually wrong in the city.
This is Los Angeles -- <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
Like it <unk> millions of other Americans, I live in a food desert. The Los Angeles Center, the home of food places to bring and eat in the car.
The curious thing is that places of food to bring people out of food than food in the car.
People are dying of <unk> diseases in Los Angeles.
For example, the obesity rate in my neighborhood is five times older than say, <unk> <unk> which is about 15 miles away.
I think this will happen.
And I ask myself, how would you feel if you didn't have access to healthy food, and if every time you go home -- you see the <unk> effects that the current food system has on their <unk>
I see chairs of <unk> wheels and sold as <unk> cars.
I see <unk> centers like <unk>
And I consider this to stop.
I think the problem is the solution.
<unk> is the problem and the solution.
And I also got tired of how to drive 45 minutes back and go back to buy an apple that doesn't have pesticides.
What I did, was we plant a forest of food in front of my house.
In a <unk> <unk> we call a <unk>
That's 45 x x 3 me.
The point is, it belongs to the city.
But you have to keep it over.
I said, "Well, I can do what I'm in <unk> because it's my responsibility and I have to <unk>
And so I decided I got it.
So my group and I, L.A. Green <unk> us and started to plant our forest of food, trees -- you know, the nine full vegetables around.
What we do, we are kind of a group laughing at <unk> made from all the <unk> of all the <unk> and completely volunteer, and everything we do is free.
And the garden, was beautiful.
Then somebody <unk>
The city got me on top and summary of giving me a <unk> saying that I had to take my garden, the <unk> became <unk>
And I said, "Come on, right?
A court order by planting the food on a piece of land than nobody <unk>  So I was like, "Well, let's <unk>
Because this time wasn't going to happen.
L.A. Times had the story written by Steve <unk> and I talked to the <unk> and one of the <unk> <unk> who put a request in <unk> with 900 <unk> was a success.
We had victory in our hands.
My <unk> even called to say that <unk> and <unk> what we were doing.
I mean, we go, why not?
L.A. is the city of America with more <unk>
It's about 68 miles of <unk>
That's about 20 Central <unk>
That's enough space to plant <unk> million <unk>
Why the Earth doesn't look like this?
<unk> a plant to <unk> 10,000 seeds.
When a dollar of <unk> I'll give you 75 dollars a result.
It's my <unk> when I tell people, you cultivate your own food.
<unk> your own food is like print your own money.
You see, I have a legacy for South America.
I grew up there. <unk> my children there.
I was encouraged to be part of this <unk> reality that was <unk> for me for others, and I'm going to manufacture my own reality.
You see, I'm an artist.
<unk> is my <unk> I farming my art.
Like a <unk> artist who <unk> walls, I <unk> soils, <unk>
I use the garden, the land, like a piece of canvas, and plants and trees, are my <unk> of that canvas.
You can see what the Earth can do, if they let be their canvas.
You just can't imagine how amazing a <unk> and how it affects the people.
What happened?
I witnessed how my garden became an education, a transformation of my neighborhood.
To change the community, you have to change the composition of the soil.
We are the land.
You can see how it affects the kids.
<unk> is the most <unk> and thought that you can do, especially in a <unk>
Also, you get <unk>
I remember one occasion, who came a mother and her daughter, were like the <unk> at night and were in my garden, left and looked very <unk>
I, well, man, I felt bad they were there, and I said, you know, you don't have to do this like this.
This is on the street for a reason.
I felt like to see people who was so close to me with hungry, and this just <unk> why I do this, people ask me, <unk> not temes people are going to steal your <unk>
What I say, "Oh my God, I am not afraid to go to <unk>
That's why it's on the street.
That's what it's about.
I want the <unk> but at the time, I want you to <unk> your <unk>
There was another occasion that I put a garden in a <unk> shelter in the center of Los Angeles.
They were these guys, who helped me download the truck.
It was great, they gave me their stories about how this had affected me and how they used to plant her mom and her grandmother, and it was fabulous to see how this changed, so it was just for a moment.
So Green <unk> has come to plant maybe 20 <unk>
We've had about 50 people who come from, work and <unk> every single volunteer plan.
If kids are growing up, kids are eating <unk>
If you grow <unk> they eat <unk>  But if none of this is <unk> if you're not taught how food is affecting the mind and the body, they eat blind what you put in front of you.
I see young people who want to work, but they have this thing in which you're caught. I see color kids who are on this path that are designed for them, that it doesn't take them nowhere.
With <unk> I see an opportunity in which we can train these kids to <unk> their communities to have a sustainable life.
And when we do this, who knows?
Maybe the next George Washington Washington <unk>
But if we don't change the composition of the land, we never will.
Now this is one of my plans, this is something I want to do.
I want to plant a whole block of gardens, where people can share food on the same block.
I want to carry <unk> and turn them into <unk> healthy.
I didn't care about it.
I'm not talking about free things, because the free is not sustainable.
What's curious about sustainability is that you have to <unk>
What I talk about is to put people to work to people, take the kids out of the street, who know the joy, the pride and the honor of growing their own food, by opening up farmers.
What I want to do here, we have to make it sexy.
I want everyone to become <unk> <unk> <unk> gardeners <unk>
We have to change the script of what's a <unk>
If you're not a <unk> you're not a <unk>
Do you pick them up, take your <unk>
That is his weapon of choice.
In <unk> if you want to meet with me, well, if you want to get to me, you don't call me if you want to sit in comfortable chairs and have meetings to talk about making some <unk> to talk about making some crap.
If you want to see me, come in the garden with your <unk> so we can plant something.
Peace Thank you.
Thank you.
<unk> --  <unk> of the <unk>  You probably would all agree with me that this is a very nice road.
It's made of <unk> and the asphalt is a good material to drive, but not always, particularly not in days as today, as it rains too much.
Can you have a lot of water on the asphalt that we <unk>
And especially if they're <unk> on your bike and these cars go out, that's not very nice.
Also, the asphalt can make a lot of noise.
It's a loud material, and if we build roads, like in the Netherlands, close to cities, you'd want a <unk> road <unk>
The solution for that is to do the road from asphalt <unk>
The asphalt is a material that we use now in most of the <unk> of the Netherlands, and it has pores and water can go through it, so all the rainwater can flow down the sides and have a road that is easy to drive, and not <unk> water.
Noise will also disappear in these <unk>
Because it's very high, all the noise is gone, so it's a very quiet road.
It also has <unk> of course, and the downside of this road is that you can <unk>
What is <unk> Look at this road the stones on the surface ran out.
First, a stone, then several more and more and more, and so on, and you say, well, I'm not going to do that.  But they can harm your <unk> and won't be happy with that.
And finally, this can also lead more and more damage.
Sometimes they can build with that.
<unk> It's ready.
<unk> of course, you can become a problem, but we have a solution.
Here you can really see how the damage appears in this material.
It's an asphalt <unk> as I said, so it only has a small amount of <unk> between stones.
Because of the <unk> light <unk> this <unk> this <unk> the glue between the <unk> <unk> and if they're <unk> they will be <unk> and they will separate from the <unk>
So, if you drive down the road, you will take the <unk> like we saw it here.
To solve this problem, we think of <unk> materials.
If we can make this material be <unk> then we probably have a solution.
So what we can do is use <unk> <unk> of that to clean up <unk> and we can cut out the steel wool into very small chunks, and we can mix those little bits with the <unk>
So we have asphalt with little bits of iron wool in it.
Then you need a machine, like you see here, that you use to <unk> a <unk> machine.
<unk> may heat, especially steel is very good at that.
So what you need to do is it's heating the steel and melt the <unk> the <unk> flow through these <unk> and the stones are <unk> back to the surface.
Today I used a <unk> <unk> because I can't bring the great machine back here to the stage.
The microwave oven is a similar system.
I put the show that I'm now going to get to see what happened.
This is the sample that comes out now.
I said we have this industrial machine in the lab to heat the samples.
We tried a lot of samples out there, and then the government, really saw our results, and they thought, "Well, that's really interesting. We have to <unk>
So we donated a piece of road, 400 feet of the <unk> highway, where we had to do a lane test to test this material.
So that was what we did there. You see where we were doing the test on the road, and then, of course, this road will last several years without any damage. That's what we know of practice.
We took a lot of samples from this road and test them in the lab.
We made aging the samples, we put a lot of burden on them, the <unk> then with our <unk> machine and the <unk> and we moved back to it.
We can repeat this many times.
Well, to conclude, I can say that we've made a material using steel fibers bringing these fibers, using the energy of <unk> to actually increase the life of the surface of the road, you can even double a lot of money on the surface.
And now, of course, they're very curious about this, it also worked.
We still have the sample here. It's pretty hot.
It's actually got to cool first before I can show you how the repair does.
But I'm going to do a try.
Let's see. Yes, it worked.
Thank you.
When I was 11, I remember having woken up a morning with the sound of the <unk> in my house.
My father was listening BBC News on his little radio radius.
He had a great smile in his face who was unusual at the time, because the news is generally <unk>
The Taliban <unk> screamed my father.
I didn't know what <unk> but I could see my father was very, very happy.
"Now you can go to a school in <unk> he said.
One morning I will never forget.
A real school.
You see, I was six years old when the Taliban were <unk> from Afghanistan and made illegal girls to go to school.
For the next five years, I was <unk> as a child to <unk> my older sister who could no longer be outside, to go to a secret school.
It was the only way the two could be <unk>
Every day, we took a different route so that nobody could suspect where to <unk>
We had to hide the books in stock bags so that it looks like that we were shopping.
The school was in a house, over 100 of a small room.
It was nice in the winter, but extremely <unk> in summer.
We all knew that <unk> our lives, the teacher, the students and our parents.
Every time the school has closed in a week, because the Taliban <unk>
We always wondered what they knew of us.
They were <unk>
Did you know where to <unk>
We were <unk> but still, school was where we wanted to be.
I was so lucky to grow in a family where education was <unk> and the daughters <unk>
My grandfather was an extraordinary man for his time.
A total <unk> of a remote province of Afghanistan. <unk> that his daughter, my mother, went to school, and so his father would <unk>
But my educated mother became a teacher.
This is her.
It took two years ago, just to turn our house into school for girls and women in our neighborhood.
And my father, this is the first of his family in getting education.
There was no question that his children had to receive education, even their daughters, despite the <unk> despite the risks.
For him, there was a greater risk in not educating their children.
Over the years of <unk> I remember that there were moments that I was very frustrated by our life and was always scared and I didn't see a future.
I wanted to give up, but my father said, <unk> daughter of mine, you can lose everything you have in life.
They can steal your money. You can <unk> them to leave your house during a war.
But there's one thing that will always be with you, what's here and if we have to sell our blood to pay your education, we will.
So, you still want not to <unk>
I'm 22 years old.
I grew up in a country that's been destroyed for decades of war.
Less than six percent of women in my age have more than high school, and if my family hadn't been so committed to my education, I would be one of them.
Instead, I find myself here proud to graduate in <unk> College.
When I went back to Afghanistan, my grandfather, which was <unk> of her home for the courage to educate his daughters, was one of the first <unk>
He was not just <unk> from my university degree, but I was the first woman, and I'm the first woman, who was driving around the streets in Kabul.
My family believed in me.
<unk> sleep, but my family has even more great dreams for <unk>
That's why I am a global ambassador, a global campaign to educate women.
It's because of what <unk> <unk> the first and perhaps the only private school for girls in Afghanistan, a country that is still risky for girls to go to school.
The exciting thing is that I see students in my school with the strong desire to harness the opportunity.
And I look at your parents and their families that, like my mine, <unk> for them, despite the face of an opposition <unk>
As <unk> It's not his true name, and I can't show you his face, but Ahmed is the father of one of my students.
It was less than a month, he and his daughter went on the way from <unk> to his village, and literally <unk> out of being killed by a bomb on the way, for minutes.
When you get to your house, they are the phone, a voice.
<unk> already, if <unk> said, "but not damaging the future of my daughter for your old old <unk>
What I've realized about Afghanistan, and it's something that is often forgotten in the West, is that behind most of the people who are <unk> there is a father who recognized the value of his daughter and he sees that the success of her own success.
It doesn't mean that our mothers have not been key to our success.
In fact, they're often the first <unk> compelling future of their daughters, but in the context of a society like Afghanistan, we need the support of men.
Under the <unk> the girls who were to school are in <unk> remember, was illegal.
But today, over three million girls go to school in Afghanistan.
Afghanistan looks so different from here in America.
I find that Americans see the fragility of changes.
You know, that these changes weren't last long after retirement American U.S.
But when I go back to Afghanistan, when I look at the students in my school and their parents that I <unk> for them, I see a future <unk> and <unk>
For me, Afghanistan is a country of hope and possibilities -- and every day the girls of <unk> would be <unk>
Like me, they dream big.
Thank you.
I've never forgotten the words of my grandmother who died in the <unk> <unk> resists <unk> against him.
But you never get a revolutionary <unk>
They've spent almost two years since the <unk> revolution broke out of the <unk> of mass <unk> so much of the <unk> revolution.
A forces with many other citizens <unk> inside and outside of the country to call a <unk> day and start a revolution against the <unk> regime of <unk>
And it was a big revolution.
Women and young men <unk> were at the <unk> <unk> the decline of the regime, carrying <unk> of freedom, dignity and social justice.
You've shown a copy of a copy of the <unk> <unk>
You've shown a great sense of solidarity from the <unk> East, to the west, to the south.
Finally, after a period of six months of brutal war and a few losses in about 50,000 dead we were able to liberate our country and <unk> to <unk>
Yet <unk> left a load of <unk> a legacy of <unk> corruption and seeds of <unk>
For four decades, the <unk> regime of <unk> destroyed the infrastructure and the moral structure of society <unk>
<unk> from the devastation and the challenges, I've loved together with many other women, rebuild civil society -- <unk> a neurological transition and just to democracy and national reconciliation and national reconciliation and national reconciliation and national reconciliation and national reconciliation and national reconciliation and national reconciliation and national reconciliation and national reconciliation and national reconciliation and national reconciliation and national reconciliation and national reconciliation and national reconciliation and national
About 200 organizations in <unk> <unk> and immediately after the fall of <unk> About 300 in <unk>
After a period of 33 years from exile, I went back to Libya and with a single enthusiasm I began to organize workshops on the development of capacities and leadership skills.
With an amazing group of women we founded the <unk> of Women <unk> <unk> by <unk> a movement of women, leaders, very <unk> <unk> to advocate for the <unk> autonomy of the woman and for our right to participate in the building of democracy and peace.
I found myself with a very difficult environment in the <unk> period, an environment that was increasingly <unk> from the selfish policies of domination, and <unk>
Over time, our initiative was <unk>
Women won an <unk> of the National Congress.
However, little to little, the <unk> of elections and the revolution as a whole, were <unk> every day we found news from violence.
One day we woke up with the news of the <unk> of mosques and <unk> <unk>
Another day I had the news of the murder of the American <unk> and the attack on <unk>
Another day we woke up with the news of the murder of the military officers in the army.
And every day, every day, we woke up with the government of <unk> and their <unk> human rights violations and their lack of respect of law.
Our society, made up by a <unk> mentality more -- more, and it's removed from ideals and principles of freedom, dignity, social justice, that we had at the beginning.
<unk> and <unk> became icons of the consequences of the revolution.
I'm not here today to <unk> with our success story of the <unk> <unk> and the elections.
Rather, I'm here today to tell you that we, as a nation, we chose badly, we take the wrong decision.
We don't prioritize good.
Because elections don't brought peace and stability and security to Libya.
The <unk> list, and the <unk> between <unk> and <unk> brought peace and reconciliation <unk>
No, they didn't.
What happened then?
Why is our society still <unk> and dominated with selfish policies of domination and <unk> as much for men as women?
Perhaps what was missing was not only women, but the female values of compassion, <unk> and <unk>
Our society needs national dialogue and the creation of consensus more than I needed the elections, which only <unk> the polarization and <unk>
Our nation needs the <unk> representation of women's more than going to need the <unk> and quantitative representation of it.
We need to stop acting as agents of outrage, and call days of anger.
We need to start acting as agents of compassion and mercy.
We have to develop a female culture, which not only <unk> but also putting the <unk> instead of <unk> collaboration instead of competition, inclusion instead of <unk>
These are the ideals that a Libya, <unk> by war, desperately desperately needs to achieve peace.
Because peace has a <unk> which is about the <unk> and the <unk> between female <unk> and <unk>
That's the real <unk>
We need to establish that in an existential way before we do it <unk>
According to a <unk> the Koran <unk> <unk> "is the word of the God <unk> <unk> <unk>
At the time, the word <unk> which is known in all of the traditions of <unk> has the same root in Arabic that the word <unk> <unk> the feminine and <unk> that spans all of the humanity that men and women, where all the tribes and all the peoples have <unk>
And so, like the uterus covers completely the <unk> growing inside, the divine matrix of compassion -- all the existence of existence.
So he goes, "My <unk> <unk>
So he goes, "My <unk> <unk> about my <unk>
That all of them are <unk> the grace of mercy.
Thank you.
I'm here today to talk about a <unk> question, which has an equally <unk> response.
It's about the secrets of domestic violence, and the question I'm going to deal with is the one that everybody else does. Why is she left?
Why would anybody stay with a man who <unk>
I'm not a psychiatrist, or a social worker, or an expert in domestic violence.
I'm just a woman with a story to tell.
I was 22 years old -- I just had <unk> at Harvard University.
I had moved to New York City by my first job as a writer and the editor at <unk> magazine.
I had my first <unk> my first <unk> American <unk> and I had a very large secret.
My secret was that many, many times, the man, that I believed my alma mater, me, <unk> the head with a <unk> charged with bullets from <unk>
The man, which I loved more than anybody in this world, put a gun gun and <unk> with <unk> more times than I can remember.
I'm here to tell you the story of <unk> <unk> a psychological trap, <unk> of love, where they fall every year, millions of women, and even some men.
It would even be your story.
I don't look like a typical survivor of domestic violence.
I'm <unk> in English at Harvard University and I have an MBA in <unk> Business <unk>
I've spent most of my career working for companies from the list <unk> <unk> between them Johnson & Johnson, Leo <unk> and The Washington <unk>
I have almost been married with my second husband -- and we have three children.
My dog is a black <unk> and drive a <unk> <unk> <unk>
So my first message to you is that domestic violence can happen to anyone, all race, all the religions, all the income levels and education.
It's all over the place.
And my second message is that everybody thinks that domestic violence happens to women, which is a problem of women.
Not exactly.
Over 85 percent of the <unk> are men, and domestic abuse, only happens in <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> or, in other ways, in the families, the last place we would want or we would expect to find <unk> -- because of domestic abuse, domestic abuse, as <unk>
I have told you that it would be the last person in the world that would be left with a man who <unk> and actually went a very typical victim because of my age.
It was 22 years old, and in the United States, women in between 16 and 24 years old have three times more likely to be victims of domestic violence than the other ages, and over 500 women and girls of that age are killed every year by partners, <unk> and husbands <unk> in the United States.
I was also a typical victim, because I knew nothing about domestic violence, their warning signs or their patterns.
I met <unk> on a cold and <unk> night <unk>
I was sitting next to me in the subway in New York City and started <unk> me.
He told me two things.
The first one was that he had also had a <unk> university -- and I was working on a very important bank of Wall Street.
But the thing that struck me about that first encounter was that it was ready and fun, and that seemed a guy in the field.
He had big <unk> and <unk> and a <unk> hair, and it seemed so sweet.
One of the smartest things that made <unk> from the beginning, was to create the illusion that I was the dominant component of a mate.
He did it especially at the beginning, <unk> in a <unk>
We started getting out and loved everything from me: which was a list that I had gone to Harvard, that I had gone to help girls, I would put my teenage girls, and my job.
I wanted to know everything about my family, my childhood, my dreams and illusions.
<unk> believed in me, as a writer and as a woman, like no one had done it before.
And it was because of that <unk> in that <unk> school and work on Wall Street and his bright future had so much relevance to it.
I didn't know that the first phase in any relationship of domestic violence is <unk> and <unk>
And I didn't know that the second step is <unk>
Now, the last thing I wanted to do was I went from New York and leave my work in my dreams, but I thought I had to do sacrifices for your partner, so I <unk> I left my job and <unk> and I went together in Manhattan.
I had no idea that he was falling into a <unk> <unk> that was coming out of my head into a physical, financial trap. <unk> <unk>
The next step of domestic violence is to introduce the threat of violence to see how it reacts to it.
And here's where those <unk> come in.
So as soon as we moved to New England you know, that site where they are supposed to be so safe and they bought three <unk>
One had in the <unk> of the car.
Another <unk> kept it under the pillow in our bed, and the third always in his pocket.
And he said he needed those guns to the trauma of a <unk>
I needed them to feel secure.
But those guns were actually a message to me, and even though I had never been able to put up my hand, my life already was serious for each minute every day.
The first physical attack of <unk> happened five days before our wedding.
It was seven in the morning and still had the <unk>
Five days later, when the 10 bruises of my neck had disappeared, I put my mother suit and married it.
Despite what had happened, he was sure that we live happy for always, because I loved him, he loved it.
And I was very, very <unk>
There was just a very <unk> sense of <unk> by the fact of being a family with me.
It had been a isolated accident, and I would never make it harm.
I spent twice on our moon of honey.
The first time I was driving up to a secret beach and <unk> and he gave me so strong in the head that <unk> various times against the <unk> of the car.
And then, a couple of days later, driving back from our <unk> <unk> went through traffic and threw a Big Mac on the face.
<unk> kept on <unk> one or twice a week for the next two and a half years of our marriage.
I was <unk> when I thought it was the only one in this situation.
One in three American women is a victim of domestic violence or <unk> at some point of their life, and the Centers for Disease Control reports that every year 15 million children are <unk> 15 million.
So, actually, I was very good company.
Going back to my question: Why am I <unk>
The answer is simple.
He didn't know he was abusing me.
Instead, I was a very strong woman in love with a deeply <unk> man, and it was the only person in the world who could help <unk> to tackle their <unk>
The other question that everybody does is why simply don't <unk>
Why didn't I get <unk> I could have gone at any time.
For me this is the saddest and painful question that people do, because us victims, we know something that you are usually <unk> is incredibly dangerous to abandon a <unk>
Because the last phase of domestic violence is <unk>
More than 70 percent of the <unk> in domestic violence happen after the victim has come to the relationship, after <unk> because then the <unk> has nothing to lose.
Other repercussions include permanent <unk> even after the <unk> has gone back to marry, <unk> financial resources, and the manipulation of family court system to <unk> the victim and their children, who normally are forced by judges to spend <unk> with the man who <unk> their mother.
And yet we keep asking why it's just not going?
I was able to go away, because of one last <unk> beating my denial.
I realized that the man who loved so much, I would have killed if he had allowed.
So I broke the silence.
I told the whole world to the world: <unk> to my neighbors, my friends and family friends and family and I am here today because all of you <unk> me.
We have the tendency to <unk> victims as <unk> <unk> women, <unk> goods.
The question, "Why do you <unk>
And some people are a way to say <unk> is by <unk> as if the victims victims, <unk> <unk> of men who want to <unk>
But since I published <unk> <unk> I've heard hundreds of stories of men and women who also agreed that they learned a <unk> lesson of what happened to them and to organize their lives joyful and happy lives and <unk> and fully free lives, like mine.
Because it turns out that I am a victim and a survivor of domestic domestic violence.
I went to <unk> with a nice and nice man and we have those three kids.
I have that black <unk> and also that <unk>
What I'm not going to be going to have ever ever had, never, ever a <unk> gun pointing to my head in someone who says I want me to me.
Right now, they are thinking, <unk> that's <unk> or <unk> what stupid <unk> but all this time I have actually been talking about you.
I assure you that there are a few people who are listening to me right now, which are being <unk> or they were being <unk> or they're <unk> themselves.
<unk> might be affecting their daughter, <unk> to his best friend right now.
I was able to end my crazy particular love that was breaking the silence.
And I keep doing it today.
It's my way to help other victims, and it's my last request to you.
Talk about what you've heard here.
<unk> thrives on silence.
They have the power to end domestic violence simply shedding light on it.
The victims of the world need everybody.
We need each of you to understand the secrets of domestic violence.
They <unk> the <unk> of the light talking about it with their children, their friends and family.
It <unk> their vision of survivors like fantastic people and <unk> who have a <unk> future.
<unk> the early signs of violence to intervene consciously, to slow down their climb and show the victims a safe <unk>
Together, we can convert our beds, our tables and our families in the <unk> safe and <unk> that they should be.
Thank you.
Hi. I call my <unk> Cameron <unk> and for a while, I'm a model.
To be precise, for 10 years.
And I feel that right now, there's a awkward tension in the room because I shouldn't have dress up like that.  Luckily, I've brought her clothes to <unk>
This is the first part of clothing on a <unk> scenario, so you have a lot of luck to <unk> I think.
If some of the women are <unk> when they <unk> they don't have to <unk> now, but I find out later on Twitter.
I also want to point out that I have the privilege of changing what you think of myself in just 10 seconds.
Not everybody has that opportunity.
These heels. They're very <unk> less bad than I don't have to.
The worst part is spending this sweater over the head, because it's going to laugh at me, so you don't do anything while you cover my head.
All right.
Why have I done this?
It's been embarrassing.
Well, I hope not as much as this picture.
The appearance is powerful, but they also <unk>
I've completely changed what they thought about in six seconds.
And in this picture, I had never had a boyfriend, in real life.
And he was totally uncomfortable and the photographer told me that he <unk> the back and he <unk> the child's hair.
Of course, with surgery or an artificial <unk> like the one that I did two days ago for work, there is very little that we could do to transform our way into it, which, even though superficial and <unk> has a huge impact on our lives.
So today, to me, being brave means to be honest.
I'm on this stage because I'm a model.
Because I'm a nice and white woman, and in my workforce, that's a sexy girl.
I'm going to answer the questions that people always do it, but <unk>
The first question is, how do you get to be model?
And I always say, a <unk> I discovered, but that doesn't mean anything.
The real reason that I made a model is because I won the genetic lottery. And I'm the <unk> of a <unk> and maybe you're wondering what this <unk>
Well, in the last centuries we haven't defined beauty as health, youth and symmetry, which are biologically programmed to <unk> we have also associated with a high and <unk> shape to <unk> and a white skin.
And that's my heritage <unk> that I've learned to take on to make money.
And I know there are people in the audience who now show up, and maybe there's some <unk> of the fashion that <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> Joan <unk> <unk> <unk>
First of all, the <unk> for knowing so much about models.
But unfortunately I have to report that in 2007, a Ph.D. student at the University of New York City told each and every one of the models in the <unk> and the <unk> models, <unk> <unk> -- is to say, less than four percent, weren't white <unk>
The next question that people always ask me is: Can it be a model when you grow up?"
And my first answer is: I don't know, I don't take care of that.
But after that, what I would really tell each of these girls is: Why? Can you be whatever you want.
You can be president of the United States, or the <unk> of the next Internet, or a <unk> surgeon ninja and poet, which would be awesome, because you are the first.
If after this <unk> list, still <unk> No, no, Cameron, I want to be a model, then I say, "I know my <unk>
Because I'm not in charge of anything, and you could be the <unk> chief of American magazine or the <unk> executive director or the next Steven <unk>
To say that most people want to be a model is like saying you want to win the lottery when you're larger.
It's out of your control, it's amazing, and it's not a job you can choose.
I'm going to demonstrate everything I learned in 10 years as a model, because, unlike surgery, <unk> it can be summarized right now.
I don't know what happened there.
Unfortunately, once you've already left your studies, and you have a resume and a couple of jobs to your back, no matter what you <unk> is to say, if you <unk> you want to be president of the United States, but your lab <unk> Model <unk> for 10 years, people will look <unk>
The next question that people always do is if all the photos are <unk>
And yeah, virtually all the pictures, but that's just a small part of what happens.
This was the first picture I <unk> and also the first time I used a <unk> and I didn't even have my period.
I know we're entering the personal field, but it was a little girl.
So I was looking at my grandmother, a few months earlier.
These two photos are the same day.
My friend came with me.
Here I am at a <unk> party a few days before the French <unk>
Here I am with my football team and <unk>
And this is me right now.
And I hope you'll realize that I'm not me in those photos.
They're <unk> from a group of professionals, <unk> photographers and <unk> and all their <unk> and people of <unk> and <unk> and they can create this. That's not me.
Well, the next question that people always ask me is <unk> things for free?
I have too many <unk> <unk> and I never have to use, except the couple previous -- but the privilege I get are the ones I get in real life, and that we don't like to talk about.
I grew up in Cambridge, and I once went to a store and I forgot to take money, and I was given the <unk>
When I was a teenager, I was traveling with my friend who was a <unk> <unk> <unk> a red light and of course, <unk> and <unk> a sorry, agent in order to keep <unk>
<unk> of these privilege for my way, not because of what I am. And there are people who are paying a price for their mind no matter who they are.
I live in New York, and last year, of <unk> teenagers who were pair and 86 percent were black and Latino men, and most of them were young men.
And there are only <unk> young black and Latino men in New York, so for them, it's not a question of <unk>
It's how many times I get <unk> and <unk>
When I looked at this talk, I found out that at 53 percent of the <unk> girls in the United States don't like their body, and that number goes down to 78 percent to the 17.
So the last question people ask me is: How is the life of a model?
And I think the answer that you expect is, if you're a little bit more thin and you have the most brilliant hair, you'll be very happy and I <unk>
And behind the cameras, we give an answer that maybe <unk>
<unk> It's really wonderful to travel, and also incredible to be able to work with ingenious creative people.
And all of that is true, but it's just a part of what happens, because what we never say in front of the cameras, what I have never said in front of them is: I'm insecure.
And I'm because I have to worry about my life every day.
And if you ever ask yourself, you know, with some more thin legs and the most bright hair will be happier?
They only have to meet with a group of models, because they have the most bright legs -- the brightest hair and the more <unk> and <unk> but probably the most insecure women on the planet.
But mostly it was hard to analyze a situation of racial oppression and gender when I'm one of the biggest <unk>
If there is something to hold out of this talk, I hope that everybody will feel more comfortable when you recognize the power of the image in the perception we have of success and failure.
Thank you.
The photograph has been my passion since I was greater enough to support a camera, but today I want to share with you my 15 more <unk> and I wasn't me who <unk>
There was no <unk> and <unk> no opportunity to repeat the pictures, not even a very minimal <unk>
In fact, most of them were <unk>
My story starts when, <unk> in New York City to give a <unk> my wife took me this picture holding my daughter on the day of his first birthday. That's the corner of <unk> and <unk>
He gave us the chance we went back to New York, just a year later, so we decided to take the same picture.
Well, you can imagine what comes right now.
When I was approaching the third birthday of my daughter, my wife told me, why don't you take me to <unk> New York on a <unk> journey, and you continue to <unk>
This is when we started to ask the tourists that were going to make us the picture.
It's amazing that the gesture of delivering the camera to a complete stranger is so universal.
No one has been denied and, fortunately, no one has <unk> with the camera.
So we weren't aware of how much it would change life this journey.
It became something sacred for us.
This photo is a few weeks after the <unk> and I had to explain to my daughter what had happened that day that I had happened that day five years could be understood.
These pictures are much more than a specific moment or a specific journey.
They're also a way to stop time in a week from October and to make us reflect on our time and our evolution over the course of years, and not just on the physical level, but in all the senses.
Because, even though we always take the same picture, our perspective changes, my daughter reaches new <unk> and I can see life through your eyes and how you perceive and interact with everything.
That time in concrete that we spend together is something that we hope with illusion all year.
So recently, in one of the trips, we were walking around, when all of a sudden, he stopped in a dry and pointed out a red <unk> of the dating store that you <unk> from small to previous <unk>
And he described what felt like the five years of standing in that same place.
<unk> that remember the <unk> heart of force to see that place for the first time nine years ago.
And now what he looks at in New York are universities, because he's determined to study in New York.
And suddenly I understood that one of the most important things we created is the memories.
So I want to share the idea of actively engaging in the conscious creation of memories.
I don't know about you, but apart from these 15 pictures, I don't go out in many of the family pictures.
I'm always the time you get the picture.
So today I want to encourage everyone to appear in the picture, and you didn't go and go over to someone and asked, let me take a picture?
Thank you.
I'd like to talk about a very special group of animals.
There are 10,000 species of birds in the world.
<unk> are in the most <unk> birds.
First, why do they have such bad <unk>
It's also associated with Disney laughter, as well as <unk> <unk> dumb stupid ones.
More recently, if they've been following the press and <unk> and applause and <unk> these are the attributes that associated with Parliament <unk> but I don't accept it.
I don't accept. You know why?
Because the members of Parliament are not clean the environment.  <unk> don't help prevent the spread of disease.
<unk> are <unk>   You're far from <unk>  And my favorite, the <unk> have better presence.   There are two types of <unk> on this planet.
There are the <unk> of the New World who are mostly found in <unk> like <unk> and <unk> and the World <unk> and we have 16 species of the World Bank, where we have 16 <unk> from extinction.
So, why are you important? First, they provide vital ecological services.
It's our <unk> natural <unk>
<unk> the cadavers up to the bone.
They help kill all the bacteria. They help to absorb the anthrax that they will not be <unk> and caused large loss of livestock and diseases in other animals.
Recent studies have shown that in areas where there are no <unk> people take three to four times in <unk> and this has huge ramifications of the spread of disease.
<unk> also have huge <unk> importance.
They've been associated with the ancient culture of <unk>
<unk> was the symbol of the lip and maternity and, along with the <unk> <unk> the unit between the <unk> and the <unk>
In the mythology of <unk> <unk> was the god <unk> and risked his life to save the <unk> goddess of the Tasmanian <unk>
In <unk> culture, they do very important <unk> to open sky -- in places like Tibet, there is no place to bury the dead or <unk> so that these <unk> provide a natural elimination system.
What's the problem with <unk>
We have eight species of <unk> in Kenya, which six are at extreme <unk>
The reason is that they're being <unk> and the reason they're being <unk> is because there are conflicts between humans and <unk> <unk> communities use this venom against predators, and as a result, the <unk> are victims of this.
In southern Asia, in countries like India and Pakistan, four species of <unk> are on the critically critical list, which means that in less than 10 or 15 years, it means that in less than 10 or 15 years of <unk> and the reason is because they fall from the livestock consumption that has been treated with a drug <unk> like <unk>
This drug has been banned for veterinarian at India and have taken a statement.
Because there's no <unk> there's been a spread in the number of dogs in <unk> <unk> and when you have dogs <unk> you have a huge bomb of time to <unk> The number of rage has increased enormously in India.
Kenya is going to have one of the biggest wind farms in Africa, <unk> <unk> are going to be up of Lake <unk>
I'm not against wind, but we have to work with governments, because wind turbines do this for birds, they cut them in half.
They're <unk> of birds.
In West Africa, there's an awful trade of <unk> dead to serve <unk> and the market market.
So what are you doing? Well, we're looking at these birds. We are <unk>
We're trying to determine its basic ecology, and see where they go.
We can see that they travel through different countries, so you can focus on a local problem -- it's not going to be at all.
We have to work with governments at the <unk> levels.
We're working with local communities.
We're talking to them about appreciating the <unk> about the need to appreciate these wonderful creatures and the services that we make.
How can they help? It can become asset to make noise. You can write a letter to your government and tell them, we need to focus on these very <unk> creatures.
When you go from this room, they were reporting about the <unk> but talk to their families, with their children, with their neighbors on the <unk>
These are very <unk> Charles Darwin said that he changed because he saw flying without effort, without spending energy spending in the heavens.
Kenya, this world will be much poorer without these wonderful species.
Thank you very much.
Every thing I do and everything I do, my life -- it's been <unk> for seven years of work during my youth in Africa.
From <unk> to <unk> <unk> young, I don't.  I worked in Zambia, Kenya, Costa Rica projects, and Somalia.
I worked for a <unk> NGO and every project that we set up in sub-Saharan Africa.
And I was <unk>
I went to the 21, that Italians were good people, and we were doing a good job in Africa.
Instead of everything that <unk> <unk>
Our first project, which inspired my first book, <unk> <unk> was a project where we were a few Italians decided to teach people about Zambia.
So we came up with seeds -- <unk> south of Zambia to this absolutely amazing valley that descends into the <unk> River.
Of course, people were not at all interested in doing that, so they were going to tell them to come to work, and sometimes they weren't <unk>  We were amazed that local in such <unk> valley, had not had agriculture.
However, instead of asking you how it might be possible that we could not say anything, we simply said, "Thank God that we're here."  <unk> time to save the people of Zambia.
And of course, everything in Africa was grown up.
So we got these magnificent <unk> in Italy, a tomato <unk> in the size of this size.
And we couldn't believe it, we were saying to the <unk> "Look how easy the <unk> is.
When the tomatoes were <unk> <unk> and red <unk> at night in the morning, about 200 <unk> appeared from the river and ate everything.  And we said to the <unk> "My God, the <unk>
And the <unk> said, "Yes, that's why we don't have agriculture here --  "Why don't you wear it, "You're never <unk>
I thought that only was the Italians <unk> errors in Africa, but then I saw what the Americans, did what Americans, and what the English would do, and after seeing what they were doing, I felt pretty proud of our project in Zambia.
Because, you see, at least we feed the <unk>
<unk> to see the <unk>  <unk> seeing the waste that will give you to <unk> people from Africa.
She wants to read a book, reading <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> economist <unk>
The book was published in 2009.
We, countries, Western donors have given the African continent two million dollars over the last 50 years.
I'm not going to tell you about damage that the money has <unk>
They just read your book.
<unk> from an African woman, the damage we've done.
The Westerners are <unk> <unk> <unk> and we treat people only two things: or <unk> or <unk>
The two words come from the Latin <unk> <unk> which means <unk>
But they mean two different things.
<unk> I treat any of a different culture like it was my kids, "Do you want me a lot."
<unk> I deal with all of the different culture as they were my <unk>
That's why the white people in Africa are called <unk>
That book gave me a slap in the face. Little <unk> <unk> written by <unk> who said for all economic development, if people don't want to be <unk> <unk>
This should be the first principle of help.
The first principle of aid is <unk>
This morning, the gentleman who opened up this conference put a cane on the floor, and he said, we can start -- you can imagine a city that's not <unk>
I decided to age 27 years only to respond to people, and I invented a system called <unk> <unk> where you never started anything, but it becomes a <unk> of local passion, the <unk> of the local people who have sleep to become a better person.
So what do you do? Do you <unk>
You never get to a community with an idea, and you sit with the people of the <unk>
We don't work from office offices.
We put together in a coffee bar.
We have zero infrastructure.
And what do we do? We become friends, and we found out what the person wants to do.
The most important thing is the passion.
You can give a sense to someone.
If that person doesn't want to do that, what is it going to do you?
The passion with her own growth is the most important thing.
The passion that man has for his own personal growth is the most important thing.
And so we helped them find the knowledge because no one in the world can succeed alone.
The person with the idea may not have knowledge, but knowledge is available.
So years and years ago, I had this idea: Why not we, for once instead of getting into a community to tell people what to do, why not, for once, they were <unk> but not in community meetings.
I'll tell you a secret.
There's a problem with community meetings.
<unk> never <unk> and they will never tell you at a public meeting -- what they want to do with their own money, which opportunity have <unk>
So planning has this <unk>
The smartest people in their community, you don't even know it, because they don't go to their public meetings.
What do we do? We work one to one, and we work face to face, you have to create a social infrastructure, which doesn't exist.
You should create a new career.
The profession is the family doctor of the company, the family doctor of the business who came out with you at your house on the kitchen table, in the coffee, and that helps you find resources to transform his passion in a way of living.
I started this as a test in <unk> city of Western Australia.
I was doing a Ph.D. in that time, trying to get away from this scar <unk> where we got to tell you what to do.
In a year, I had 27 projects started, and the government came to see me to ask, "How can you do that?
How can we do it? And I said, "I did something really, really, really difficult.
So the government goes, <unk>  So the government says, <unk> <unk>  So we've done it in 300 communities in the world.
We have helped to start 40,000 businesses.
There is a new generation of entrepreneurs who are dying of loneliness.
Peter <unk> one of the greatest business <unk> business <unk> years passed away to '96, a few years ago.
Peter <unk> was a professor of philosophy before they get involved in business, and this is what Peter <unk> <unk> is actually incompatible with a society and a <unk> economy.
<unk> is the kiss of the death of the business <unk>
So now we <unk> rebuilding <unk> without knowing what the most <unk> people in <unk> want to do with their own money and their own energy.
You have to learn how to get these people to come to talk to you with you.
You have to offer you <unk> privacy, it has to be fantastic to the <unk> and then you <unk> they will be mass.
In a community of 10,000 people, we get 200 customers.
You can imagine a community of 400,000 people, intelligence and passion?
What do you talk about is this tomorrow?
<unk> local <unk> That's what you have <unk>
So, what I say is that the entrepreneur spirit is where it is.
We are at the end of the first industrial revolution <unk> fossils that are not renewable and <unk> and one moment to another, we have systems that are not sustainable.
The internal combustion engine is not sustainable.
<unk> as a way of holding <unk> is not sustainable.
What we have to consider, is how to <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> to communicate to seven billion people, in a sustainable way.
There is no technologies to do it.
Who is going to invent technology for the green revolution, <unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk>
They will be entrepreneurs and they're doing it now.
There is a lovely story that I read in a magazine magazine many, many years ago.
There was a group of experts who were invited to debate the future of New York City in <unk>
And in the year <unk> he gathered this group of people, and <unk> what would happen to New York City in 100 years, and the conclusion was <unk> the city of New York weren't in 100 years.
Why? Because they analyzed the curve and <unk> if the population is kept growing up to this <unk> to move to the population of New York to <unk> <unk> six million horses and the manure produced by six million horses that would be impossible to <unk>
They were already <unk>   So in <unk> they were <unk> this dirty technology that <unk> New York life.
So what happens? Over the next 40 years, in 1900, in the United States appeared -- <unk> companies <unk> <unk>
The idea of finding a different technology was absolutely <unk> and there were very few <unk> factories in <unk> places.
<unk> Michigan. Is Henry Ford.
But there is a secret to work with the entrepreneurs.
First, you have to offer you <unk>
Otherwise they won't come up with you.
Then you have to give you an absolute <unk> service <unk>
And then finally, you will have to tell you the truth with respect to <unk>
The youngest company, the biggest company, has to be able to do three things: the product you want to sell has to be fantastic, you have to have a fantastic marketing -- and you have to have a fantastic management
Guess what?
We have never met a single human being in the world that I can do, sell and search for the money alone.
It doesn't exist.
This hasn't wasn't born.
We've looked at the 100 <unk> companies in the Arab world, <unk> <unk> Ford, Ford -- all the new companies -- Google, <unk>
There is only one thing that all the successful companies in the world have in common, only one. No one was started by one person.
Never word <unk> but the word <unk> 32 times.
He wasn't just when he started.
No one begins a company itself.
So we can create the community where we have <unk> who come from a small business environment -- <unk> in <unk> along with their dedicated comrades who will do for you, what somebody did for you, who is a gentleman who speaks about this <unk> somebody who says to you, what <unk>
What can you?
Well, you can <unk> it can look for <unk>
"Oh, no, I can't do that." <unk> to <unk>
We activate communities.
Thank you.
Those around us can help us in many ways to improve our lives.
We don't know all the neighbors, so we won't swap a lot of knowledge even though we share the same public spaces.
In the last few years I've been trying to share more with my neighbors in public space, with simple tools like <unk> templates and chalk.
These projects came from questions like, how much pay my neighbors for their <unk>
How can we pay and borrow more things without calling the door in a bad time?
How do we share more memories of our abandoned buildings and understand better our <unk>
How do we share more of our hopes for empty stores so that our communities can reflect our needs and <unk>
I live in New York, and I'm in love with New <unk>
My soul will always find a relief with the giant <unk> that <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> for centuries and I trust a city.
It always wrestled for music.  There's a <unk> <unk>  The city has one of the most beautiful architectures in the world, but also one with the greatest number of abandoned abandoned properties.
I live close to this house and I thought how it could turn it into a rather nice space for the neighborhood and also in something that changed my life forever.
In 2009, I lost somebody who loved a lot.
It was <unk> like a mother for <unk>
His death was sudden and unexpected.
I thought a lot about death and I thought a lot about death and I thought a lot about death with.
And that produced me a profound gratitude for the lived and the lived time.
He gave it clear to the significant things of my life today.
But let me go through this kind of look in my everyday life.
It seems to me that it's easy to be able to be able to catch the day and forget what's really important for you.
So with the help of old and new friends transformed the wall of this giant <unk> on a giant <unk> and he painted over her phrases to <unk> "Before he died <unk>
So <unk> could take a <unk> reflect on their lives and share personal aspirations in the public space.
I didn't know what to wait for this experiment, but the next day the wall was filled and still <unk>
And I'd like to share some things that people wrote on the wall.
Before he died, I want to be <unk>   Before I die -- I want to sit on the line of <unk>
Before I die I want to sing for millions of people."
Before I die I want to plant a <unk>
Before I die I want to live outside the <unk>
Before I die I want to <unk> you once again."
Before I die I want to go to the <unk>
Before he died, I want to be completely myself."
This abandoned space became <unk> and the dreams and hope of people made me laugh at <unk> and <unk> me and gave me solace in difficult times.
It's about knowing that you're not alone. It's about understanding our neighbors in new and new ways that is trying to accommodate the reflection and <unk> and remember what is most important for us as we grow and <unk>
This happened last year, and I started getting hundreds of messages from passionate people who wanted to make a wall in their community.
And so with my colleagues at the civic center we did a kit and now they've made walls in countries around the world, like <unk> South Africa, Australia, Argentina and beyond.
And together we demonstrated the power of our public spaces if they give us the opportunity to express ourselves and share each other.
Two of the most valuable things we have are time and our relationships with other people.
In our age of programmers in the rise. It is more important than ever before, to find ways of preserving the perspective and remembering that life is short and fragile.
death is something that we often avoid talking, or even thinking, but I understood that we are preparing for death to be one of those things that are more power.
And if you think about death to be <unk> our life.
Our shared spaces can reflect better than us as individuals and as community and more media to share hope, fears and stories, people around us cannot help improve places, can help improve our lives.
Thank you.
Thank you.
I have a only request.
Please don't tell me that I'm normal.
Now I'd like to introduce you to my brothers.
<unk> is 22 and very <unk>
So not speak, but it makes joy better than some of the best speakers.
<unk> knows what love is.
It's shared. <unk> happens what will happen.
It's not <unk> They don't look at the color of the skin.
It doesn't matter the religious differences and notice this -- it's never <unk>
When singing songs of our childhood, trying to say words that I didn't even think of it, it reminds me of one thing: how little we know about the mind and how wonderful it must be the unknown.
Samuel is 16 years old. She's too hot.
<unk> the <unk> memory.
However, it's a selective memory.
It doesn't remember if I stole my <unk> but remember the year that every one of the songs of my iPod, conversations that we <unk> when I was four years old, I would pee in my arm during the first episode of the <unk> and the birthday of Lady <unk>
You don't seem cool?
But most people don't agree with it.
And in fact, because your minds don't fit into the concept of <unk> they often are <unk> and <unk>
But what propelled my heart and <unk> my soul was that even if that was the case, even though they didn't consider them in the <unk> that could only mean one thing: they were <unk> autistic and remarkable.
Now, for those less familiar with the term <unk> it's a complex brain disorder that affects social communication, learning and sometimes to physical skills.
In each individual of each individual it manifests itself different from there that <unk> is so different to Sam.
And all over the world, every 20 minutes, you're diagnosed with a new case of autism, and even though it's one of the development disorders that faster increases in the world, there's no cause or <unk>
I don't remember my first encounter with autism, but I don't remember one day without it.
I was only three years old when my brother came to the world, and I was very excited about having a new life in my life.
When I spent a few months, I realized that he was different.
<unk> a lot.
I didn't want to play like the other babies and actually didn't seem very interested in me at all.
<unk> lived and <unk> in his own world, with his own rules, and I found pleasure on the smallest things like putting the cars in row around the room, looking at the washing machine around the room, looking at the washing machine and eating anything that was <unk>
As I was growing more different, and the differences were made more evident.
But beyond <unk> the frustration and the <unk> <unk> there was something really <unk> a pure and innocent nature that I saw the world without biases, a human being had never <unk>
<unk>
I can't deny that there have been some difficult moments in my family, when I would have wanted them to be just like me.
But I look back at the things that have taught me about individuality, and communication and love, and I realize that they are things that would not want to change the normal.
<unk> happens by high the beauty that give us the differences and the fact of being different doesn't mean that some is wrong.
It just means that there's a different vision of what's right.
If I could <unk> one thing to <unk> and Sam and you might have to be normal.
They can be extraordinary.
Because, autistic or not, the differences that you <unk> is a <unk> Every one of us has a gift inside and honestly, the pursuit of <unk> is the last <unk> of the potential.
The opportunity for <unk> progress and change is dying at the moment where we try to be like others.
Please don't tell me that I'm normal.
Thank you.
Five years ago, I experienced a little bit of what must have been <unk> in the country of <unk>
Penn State asked me, a communications teacher, I gave a class of communication to engineering students.
I was scared.  <unk> really <unk> from these students with their great minds, and their great books and the great <unk> words.
But as those conversations, I felt what <unk> must have felt when he fell through the <unk> hole and saw the door of a new world.
And so I felt when I had those conversations with the students, I was surprised the ideas that they had, and I wanted others to experience this wonderful world.
And I think the key to opening that door is a great communication.
We desperately need a great communication of our scientists and engineers in order to change the world.
Our scientists and engineers are the ones that are attacking our biggest challenges -- from energy to the environment and health care between others, and if we don't know about it, work is not done, and I think it's our responsibility as we don't have to have these interactions.
But these big conversations can't happen if our scientists and engineers are not invited to see their wonderful world.
So scientists and engineers, please get <unk>
I want to share some suggestions on how you can do it to make sure that your science is sexy and your engineering is attractive.
First questions for <unk> and then what?
<unk> why is science relevant to us.
They don't simply tell us that we study the <unk> but they study the <unk> that are the mesh structure of our bones because it's important to understand and treat <unk>
And when you're describing your science, they care about <unk>
<unk> is an obstacle to our understanding of their ideas.
Sure, you can say <unk> and <unk> but why not say <unk> and <unk> which is much more accessible to us?
<unk> affordable is not the same thing to make them <unk>
Instead, as Einstein, as Einstein said, everything as simple as possible, but not simple.
They can communicate clearly their science without engaging with ideas.
One thing to consider is to use examples, stories and analogies -- are ways of <unk> and <unk> with their content.
And by presenting his work, forget about the signs of <unk>
So you've been wondering why they call <unk>  What do you call them -- the bullets -- the bullets -- and they <unk> their presentation.
A <unk> like this is not just boring, but it's being supported too much in the language of our brain and <unk>
Instead, this <unk> example of <unk> Brown is much more effective, it shows that the special structure of <unk> is so strong that inspired the unique design of the <unk> <unk>
And the trick here is to use a simple line, <unk> that the audience can understand if you lose a bit, and then you provide graphs that <unk> our other senses and create a deeper sense of understanding of what it was <unk>
I think these are just some key ones that can help others open the door and look at the country of the wonders that is science and engineering.
And so, scientists and engineers, when you've solved this equation, by all media, <unk> with <unk>  Thank you.
One of my favorite words from all over the Oxford English <unk> is <unk>
Just because it sounds pretty good.
And <unk> means <unk> <unk>
Even though there was an editor of the 19th century that defined a lot of better when he said, "A <unk> is that he looks for a public <unk> no matter or <unk> and that when he won, it gets by the mere use of a monumental <unk> <unk>
I have no idea what it means <unk>
Something to do with words, I guess.
It's very important that words are the basis in politics, and that all politicians know they have to try to master the language.
It wasn't <unk> for example, <unk> that British Parliament allowed the newspapers to quote the exact words they were saying in the <unk> camera.
And all of this was because of the bravery of a guy with the <unk> named <unk> <unk> who faced <unk>
They put him in the <unk> Tower and <unk> but he had enough courage to face them, and eventually he had such popular support in London that I won.
And only a few years later, we had the first recorded use of the phrase <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> like <unk>
Most of them think it's <unk>
It's not. It's because of an advocate of freedom of expression.
But to show you really how words and politics interact, I want you to go back to America, just after independence.
So, they had to address the question of how to call George Washington a leader.
You didn't know.
How do you call the leader of a country <unk>
This was <unk> in Congress for a long time.
They were presented to all sorts of suggestions that they could have <unk>
Some people wanted to call it <unk> from <unk> and others, "Your <unk> George <unk> and other <unk> from the <unk> of the American <unk>
Not very <unk>
Some people simply wanted to call it <unk>
They thought it was tested quality.
And not even with it were <unk> they had the idea that you could be elected King for a given time.
And I could have <unk>
Everybody got tired of it, because this debate was <unk> for three weeks.
And I read the newspaper of a poor <unk> and I always <unk> <unk> with this <unk>
What caused the <unk> and the <unk> was that the House of Representatives were against the <unk>
The House of Representatives didn't want Washington to be <unk> of power.
They didn't want to call it the King for if he did not give him to him or his designated ideas.
So they wanted to give the title more <unk> more <unk> and <unk> that came up with it.
And that title was <unk>
So he didn't invent the title. There was before, but it only meant <unk> that <unk> a <unk>
It was like the president of a jury.
And I didn't have much more <unk> than the term <unk> or <unk>
There were <unk> presidents of small <unk> <unk> and <unk> of government, but it was actually a trivial title,
And that's why the Senate is <unk>
They said, "is ridiculous, we can't call it <unk>
This guy has to sign up and meet with <unk> <unk>
"And who will take you seriously with a <unk> <unk> <unk> as <unk>
And finally, after three weeks of debate, the Senate wasn't <unk>
We can learn three interesting things about this.
First of all, and this is my favorite story to where I've been able to figure out, the Senate has never been <unk> for the title of President.
President Barack Obama is fortunate enough to keep up there, waiting for the Senate to <unk>
The second thing we can learn is that when a government says that a measure is <unk>  <unk> possible that we keep waiting for <unk> years.
But the third thing that we can learn, and this is the most important thing, and I want to suggest to you, is that the President President of America doesn't sound as modest today, right?
Especially if you have more than 5,000 nuclear warheads available, the biggest economy of the world and a fleet of <unk> air <unk>
Reality and history have endowed with the title of <unk>
So I finally won the <unk>
They got his title of <unk>
And also the other concern about the Senate, the appearance of <unk> well, it was <unk>
But you know how many nations have now <unk>
And everything because they want to sound like the guy who has the 5,000 nuclear heads and so on.
So, at the end, the Senate won and the House of <unk> <unk> because no one is going to feel humble when you tell them that now it's President <unk>
And I think that's the great lesson that we can learn, and I want to <unk>
Politicians are trying to choose and use the words to shape and control reality, but actually change a lot more the words that these might change reality.
Thank you very much.
I'm 45 to meters under the land in a illegal Ghana.
The air is <unk> and dust and it's hard to breathe.
I feel the touch of bodies in the dark, but I can't see much more.
I hear voices that talk about, but above all, that cacophony of <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> with primitive.
Like others, I wear a cheap firefly <unk> he stayed on the head with this <unk> <unk> and I can barely tell the <unk> <unk> <unk> walls that are held up hundreds of meters on the ground.
It was <unk> my hand and suddenly I remember a <unk> I met days earlier, who lost the control and fell <unk> feet in that toilet.
As I talk to you today, these guys are deep in the deep <unk> of that hole in the risk of your lives without paying any rewards and, often, dying.
I went out of that hole, and I went home, but they may never do it, because they're <unk>
In the last 28 years I was documenting native cultures in over 70 countries in six continents, and in 2009, I had the great honor of being the only <unk> in the Peace Summit <unk>
Among all the amazing people I met there I met an <unk> <unk> the <unk> an NGO which is <unk> to eradicate modern slavery.
We started talking about slavery and, really, I began to learn about slavery because I knew there was in the world, but not to just grade.
When we finished talking, I was very angry, I honestly was <unk> to ignore this <unk> of our days and I thought, if I don't know, how many people don't know?
He made me <unk> the stomach and weeks later, I flew to Los Angeles to meet the director of <unk> the <unk> and offer my help.
So my journey started my journey to modern slavery.
Interestingly, I've been in many of these places.
Some of us will even consider it my second home.
But this time, <unk> the dirty ones.
A conservative calculation says that there are now more than 27 million people <unk> in the world.
It's twice the number of African Africans throughout the whole <unk> <unk>
150 years ago, the cost of a farmer slave at about three times the annual salary of an American worker.
The equivalent of about 50,000 people today.
And yet, today you can <unk> together for entire families by generations and <unk> <unk> <unk>
Amazingly, slavery generates profit from more than 13 billion dollars a year across the world.
Many have been <unk> with fake promises of good education, better work to find that they are obliged to work without paid under threat to violence and cannot escape.
Today, slavery operate in <unk> the <unk> goods produced by slaves have value, but those who produce these disposable people.
<unk> exists in most of the world, and yet it's illegal in the world.
In India and Nepal, I met the <unk>
This strange, <unk> show was like entering the old Egypt or the <unk> <unk>
<unk> in a temperature of 54 degrees C, men, women, children, in fact, -- in fact, entire families were <unk> in a heavy <unk> of <unk> frames, in their heads up to 18 at the time, and they take them from <unk> <unk> to trucks that are at hundreds of meters.
<unk> by <unk> and <unk> work in silence, doing this task and again for 16 or 17 hours a day.
There was no <unk> to eat, or to drink, and the severe <unk> made that pee out pretty <unk>
So <unk> were the heat and the dust that my camera became too hot on it, and he stopped working.
Every 20 minutes I had to run the car to clean up the team and make it work with air conditioning to <unk> and, sitting there, I thought, my camera gets a much better treatment than these people.
Back in the <unk> I wanted to cry but the <unk> that I was going to very quickly grabbed me and said, <unk> don't do it. Don't do it here."
And he explained to me very clearly to demonstrate emotions is very dangerous in places like this, not just for me but for them.
I couldn't offer any direct help.
I couldn't give you money, nothing.
I was not citizenship in that country.
He could put them in a situation worse than they were already.
I had to rely on <unk> the <unk> and work inside the system for its release and trusted that he <unk>
In terms of me, I waited to get home to feel my heart <unk>
In the Himalayas I found children carrying rocks for miles on the ground up to the trucks to the bottom.
Those big <unk> were more heavy than the kids who load them and children <unk> their heads with <unk> <unk> made of <unk> strings and <unk>
It's hard to see something so <unk>
How can we influence something so <unk> but so <unk>
Some people don't even know that they're slaves -- and they work 16 or 17 hours a day without <unk> because this has been the whole life.
They have nothing to <unk>
When these villagers <unk> his freedom, the <unk> had completely <unk>
When you hear the word <unk> we often think of sexual traffic, and because of this global consciousness, I was told that it would be difficult to me to work with security in this particular business.
In <unk> I was <unk> women who had previously been previously <unk>
And he took me on a few <unk> that gave this <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
It wasn't exactly a <unk>
It was a restaurant.
<unk> as you know in the craft, they are locals for forced prostitution.
They have small rooms -- private rooms -- where the <unk> <unk> with their girls and children, some of the only seven -- are forced to <unk> the clients and <unk> to buy more food and alcohol.
Every place is dark and <unk> identified by a number painted on the wall and divided by a <unk> and a curtain.
The workers often suffer sexual abuse to their clients.
On the <unk> I remember a sense of <unk> <unk> and, in that moment, I barely could imagine what should be stuck in that hell.
I just had a <unk> the stairs where he <unk>
There was no <unk>
There were no windows big windows for <unk>
These people don't have <unk> and because we play a very difficult issue, it's important to point that slavery, even sexual <unk> is happening around us.
There are hundreds of people living in agriculture, in <unk> in the domestic service, and the list can continue.
Recently, the New York Times reported that between 100,000 and 300,000 American children are sold every year as a sex <unk>
This is everywhere, but we don't see it.
<unk> are another activity that often interact with labor <unk>
I went to Indian villages where there were entire families in the trade of silk.
This is a family.
The black hands of black are the father, the <unk> of blue and red, from their children.
<unk> <unk> in these big barrels and <unk> the silk in the liquid to <unk> but <unk> is <unk>
My performer told me his stories.
"We don't have <unk> they said.
We still hope, yet you can get out of this house one day and go to another place where we really pay our job."
It is estimated that there are over 4,000 children in Lake <unk> the largest artificial lake in the world.
When we arrived, I got a quick look at it.
I saw what seemed like a family of fishermen on a boat, two older brothers, some younger kids, it makes sense, right?
<unk> They were all slaves.
Children are separated from their families and <unk> <unk> and forced to work <unk> a long time on these boats -- despite not knowing swimming.
This child is eight years old.
When our boat came up to come up with it <unk> that his little canoe <unk>
He was paralyzed by the fear of falling into the water.
The branches of the trees <unk> in Lake <unk> often trap networks and children, <unk> and <unk> is thrown into water to unleash the branches.
Many are <unk>
Since remember, it's always been forced to work on the lake.
For fear of his love it's not going to flee and, like all the life has been treated with cruelty, <unk> tries to slaves younger children under their command.
I met these guys at five o'clock in the morning, when they <unk> the latest networks, but they had been working on the <unk>
It was cold and <unk>
And you can point out that these networks weigh over 400 kilos when they're filled with fish.
I want to introduce you to <unk>
Kofi was rescued in a village of fishermen.
I met him in a shelter where the <unk> <unk> victims of slavery.
Kofi symbolizes as possible.
Who will come to be because somebody decided to make a difference in your life?
He was <unk> by a road in Ghana with partnerships with <unk> the <unk> a companion.
He asked us to do it on a path of land to the forest.
At the end of the way, we would get rid of the car, and he asked the driver to go out quickly.
And then he pointed out this path just visible and said, "This is the way, this is the road.
As we started down, we took the <unk> out of the road to <unk> the path and after walking around an hour I was <unk> by the recent <unk> so I put the photos of photos on my head as I put it into these waters, to the chest.
After two hours of <unk> the <unk> path ended up <unk> in a clear, and we had a mass of holes that I could fit into a football field, and they were all filled with migrant workers.
And so many women had children tied up to their back, and as they were looking for gold gold, they were <unk> in <unk> water.
<unk> is used in the process of <unk>
These miners are <unk> in a well in another part of Ghana.
When they went out of the pump they were <unk> in their own <unk>
I remember looking at his eyes tired, <unk> because many had been under land for 72 hours.
The pits are up to 90 feet and these people carry loads of stone bags that then is going to be shipped to another area where they <unk> the stone to extract the gold.
In the first view, the site seems to be full of strong men and <unk> but if you look closer, but if we look closer, the margin we see to work at other <unk> and also children.
They're all victims of injuries, and disease and violence.
In fact, it's very likely that this <unk> will end up as this victim of tuberculosis and <unk> in a few years.
This is <unk> When his uncle died, he took him to work with him in mines.
By the death of his uncle, <unk> <unk> the debt of the uncle who is force to be slave in mines.
When I met him, he had worked in the mines 14 years and the leg injury you see here is a product in the <unk> so serious that the doctors said that he should be <unk>
In addition to that, <unk> has tuberculosis, and yet it's forced to work night and day on that mine.
Yet, he has been liberated and educated with local activists as <unk> the <unk> and this is this kind of determination, of face to a remote possibility that inspires me a lot of respect.
I want to throw light about slavery.
Did you know that their images would be seen by you all over the world.
I wanted you to know that we will give us testimony to them, and we will do everything that we could to help change their lives.
I really believe that if we can see each other as human beings, then it becomes very difficult to tolerate atrocities like slavery.
These images are not <unk> These are real people, like you, and like me, who deserve the same rights, dignity and respect in their lives.
There is no day that I don't think of these so many people beautiful, <unk> that I've had the great honor to know.
I hope that these images wake up a force in which you see them in people like you, and I hope that that force will turn on a fire and that <unk> light on slavery because without that light, the beast of slavery can continue to live in the shadows.
Thank you very much.
I do mathematical mathematics, and there is a peculiar problem for whom <unk> are like the management teams.
Nobody knows what the hell we do.
So today, I'm going to try to explain to you what I do.
<unk> is one of the most human activities.
We <unk> the <unk> of the ballet and the dancers of <unk>  that we will see later on.
But the ballet demand for extraordinary training is a high level of dexterity and probably some initial <unk> that can be a genetic component.
Sadly, psychiatric disorders like Parkinson's Parkinson's failure, this extraordinary ability as it does with my friend <unk> <unk> who, at the time was a virtuous dancer dancer <unk>
In the last few years, we've made a lot of progress on treatment.
But there are <unk> millions of people in the world who are sick, and they have to deal with a <unk> <unk> <unk> and other symptoms of this disease, so we need <unk> tools to detect the disease before it's too late.
We need to be able to measure the progress in an objective way, and ultimately, the only way we will know if there is really a cure that we will be when we have an objective metric and <unk>
But it's frustrating that for Parkinson's and other disorders of the movement are not all <unk> so they don't have blood analysis and the best we have is a <unk> <unk>
You have to go to a clinic to do it. It's very, very expensive, and that means that outside of clinical trials, they never have ever done.
And what if patients could do it at home?
That would save a <unk> trip to the clinic. What if patients could get the test <unk>
It doesn't need to be personal.
By the way, it costs about 300 dollars on the <unk>
So what I want to <unk> as a way that is not conventional to a try, you see, in some sense at least we are all <unk> like my friend <unk> <unk>
This is a video of the <unk> <unk>
It shows someone healthy as it emits sounds to talk to each other, and we can imagine as dancers of a vocal vocal <unk> because we have to coordinate all those vocal organs to produce sounds and all of us have the <unk>
And as they did it, it requires an extraordinary training level.
Let's think about the time that leads to a child learning to speak.
So from sound, we can track the position of vocal cords as we <unk> and as well as Parkinson's affects <unk> it is also affecting the <unk> organs.
In <unk> <unk> you can see an example of <unk> <unk> of vibrating strings.
We see the same <unk>
shake and <unk> and <unk>
The speech becomes more quiet and <unk> after a while, and this is an example of the symptoms.
How do you compare these tests based on the voice with the clinical trials. Well, they're both not <unk>
The neurological test is not <unk> they both use existing infrastructure.
You don't need to design a whole series of hospitals to do them.
Both are <unk> OK, but also <unk> tests are not <unk>
I mean, they can be <unk>
They do very quickly, take about 30 seconds as a lot.
They're <unk> and we all know what happens.
When something takes a <unk> cost on massive scale.
These are some amazing goals to <unk>
We can reduce the patient difficulty <unk>
You wouldn't need to go to clinic for routine.
<unk> <unk> we could get objective data.
We could make mass recruiting at low cost for clinical trials, and for the first time, <unk> <unk> at scale.
We have the opportunity to start looking for the first <unk> of the disease before it's too late.
So by giving today the first steps in that sense, we're launching the Modern <unk>
Together with <unk> and <unk> we want to register a lot of voices around the world to gather enough data and begin to address these targets.
We have accessible lines for about 750 million people in the world.
<unk> with or <unk> I can call low price and leave recordings for a few cents. And I'm very pleased to announce that we've reached six percent of the goal in just eight hours.
Thank you.  Tom Rielly: So let's just take all these samples of, say, 10,000 people, you can say who is healthy and who isn't it?
What are you going to take from these <unk>
Max <unk> Yeah, yes. What happens is that during the call you have to indicate if you have or not the disease. TR: Sure.
<unk> You see, some people may not <unk> You may not <unk>
But we're going to get a very big sample of <unk> data in different circumstances, and do it in different circumstances is important because we're looking at <unk> the factors of the confusion of the disease of disease.
TR: Do you have a accuracy <unk>
<unk> much more than that.
Actually, my student <unk> I have to <unk> has done a fantastic work and now it has shown that it works on the mobile phone network, as well, what we <unk> the project. Now we have 99 percent accuracy.
TR: <unk> and nine. Well, it's a improvement.
<unk> Absolutely.
TR: Thank you very much. Max <unk> public.
<unk> Thank you, <unk>
Before March of 2011, I did <unk> <unk> in New York City.
We are <unk> creatures.
We fall out in the dark, in the ground, and usually we avoid sunlight.
We do the thin models, even more <unk> the perfect skin -- we do the impossible, we do the impossible, we do the impossible, and we were <unk> in the press all the time, but some of us are really artists with talent with many years of experience and a real taste of the images and photography.
On March 11, in 2011, I saw from my house, just like the rest of the world, the <unk> events that were happening in Japan.
Little time later, an organization that was <unk> there was <unk> <unk> in the place working as part of the <unk>
I, along with hundreds of other volunteers we knew that we couldn't sit at home, so I decided to join the group for three weeks.
On May 13 in May I traveled to <unk>
It's a little <unk> village in <unk> <unk> of almost 50,000 people, one of the first villages affected by the wave.
The <unk> water level reached over 24 feet high, and over three kilometers the inside.
As you can imagine, the village was <unk>
<unk> rubble from channels and <unk>
<unk> schools.
We took tons and tons of fish, <unk> <unk> of the local factory.
We <unk> and they loved it.
For weeks, so many volunteers like the neighbors found similar things.
They found photos and <unk> photos and cameras and cameras and <unk>
Everybody did the same thing.
We <unk> and take them to different places of villages around them for <unk>
It wasn't until I realized that those pictures represented an enormous part of the personal losses that people had <unk>
As I was fleeing the wave, and to save his lives, they had to abandon everything they had.
At the end of my first week I started to help in a <unk> center of the people.
It helped clean the <unk> <unk> giant <unk>
This place turned out to be the place in the village where the center of <unk> <unk> the photos.
And I had the honor I had the honor of that day to go to clean up the photos.
This was exciting and inspiring, I had heard the expression to think beyond the <unk> but it wasn't until I went beyond my horizons that something happened.
By looking at the photos, I found some of the more than a hundred years, some of them were still in the lab -- I couldn't stop thinking about how to fix that <unk> and repair that <unk> and I knew hundreds of people who could do the same thing.
So that night I walked into Facebook contacted some of them, and the next morning the answer was so overwhelming and positive that I knew we had to try.
So we started <unk> the photos.
This was the first of all.
It wasn't too <unk> but where the water had <unk> the face of the girl had to be <unk> with a lot of precision and <unk>
Anyway, that little girl would not have the aspect of her, and that would be so tragic as I had the photo <unk>
Over the time of time, they came by luck more and needed more <unk> so it was more <unk> so I went back on Facebook and <unk> and five days later 80 days later 80 countries was offered to help.
Within two weeks, I had 150 people who were <unk>
In Japan, in July, we got <unk> to <unk> a <unk> neighbor to the north of <unk>
Once a week we use our scanner in the libraries in the libraries that had been <unk> where people were going to reclaim their photos.
The time that we <unk> in <unk> is a different story, depended on the <unk> of the photos.
It could take an hour. It could make a weeks.
It could make a few months.
This <unk> had to draw virtually by hand using the areas whose color and detail the water wasn't destroyed.
It took a lot of time.
The water destroyed all of these pictures <unk> in saltwater, covered in bacteria, with seaweed, even oil, all of it together with the pace of time I continue to get rid of it was an important part of the project.
We couldn't afford the photo unless I was clean and dry and had been <unk> by their <unk>
We were lucky with <unk>
We have a <unk> <unk>
It's very easy to harm even more <unk>
As once he once said, the leader of my group is how to make a tattoo.
You can't make mistakes.
The woman who brought us these pictures was lucky to the photos.
He had begun to <unk> her, but he stopped to realize that <unk> even more.
He also had <unk>
Without them, the images of her husband and their own face would not have predicted. We were able to <unk> the images in a single photo and put the whole picture.
When they collected their pictures shared something about his story with us.
A lot of colleagues of her husband found the photos on a fire station between the rubble far away from where he used to be his house, but his colleagues will <unk>
The day of the tsunami, his husband was the experimenter to close the barriers to the wave.
He had to go inside the water while the <unk> <unk>
Their children, not so small now, but their two children were in school, in different schools.
One of them stuck in the water.
He took a week to find his entire family and know that they all survived.
The day I gave him his photos her son less to be 14 years old.
For her, despite all this, those pictures were the best gift I could <unk> something that he could go back to look, something that I could remember from the past day that had not been marked by that day from March when everything in his life changed or was destroyed.
After six months in Japan 1,100 volunteers had joined us up to <unk> hundreds of them helped us to clean up <unk> photographs -- the great <unk> -- the vast majority of them came into their own <unk>
More than 500 volunteers around the world helped us back to 90 families and hundreds of <unk> and <unk> and <unk>
During this time, we really don't spend more than a thousand dollars in teams and materials and mostly <unk>
We took pictures all the time.
One photo is a remember of somebody or something, a relationship, a guy wanted.
They are <unk> from our memories and stories, the last thing we would take but the first thing to look for.
This is about the project, to restore small pieces of humanity, to return to somebody that connection to the past.
When a picture like this is coming back to somebody, it's an enormous difference in the life of the person who receives it.
This project also made a big difference in the life of <unk>
Some of them connected them to something larger -- I'll give you something, using their talent to something that are not models of perfect skin.
So I would like to read this email. And I sent him Cindy the day I came back from Japan after six months.
As I <unk> I couldn't stop thinking about people and the stories shown in the images.
One particular one was a shot with women of different ages from Grandma to the young child, gathering around a baby, <unk> because a similar picture of my family my grandmother, my mother, my mother, and my daughter just <unk> hangs on our wall.
In the whole world, in all of our basic needs are the same. Right?
Thank you.
<unk> <unk> inspired us and curiosity with this picture of a bullet that goes through an apple in an apple exhibition on just one millionth of a second.
But now, 50 years later, we can go a million times faster and see the world not one million or a billion, but a billion frames per second.
I present to you a new kind of <unk> <unk> a new technique that can create video in slow motion from light moving.
And with that, we can create cameras that you can see after the <unk> beyond the line of vision, or seeing the interior of the body without using X-rays, without using rays of the camera.
If I take a laser pointer and turn it into it and fold it into a second, second, in various <unk> create a pack of photons just a millimeter long.
And that package of photons, that <unk> travel to the speed of light, and again, a million times faster than a common bullet than a bullet <unk>
If we take that bullet and this <unk> pack of photons and <unk> in this bottle, how do you disperse those photons into this <unk>
What's the aspect of light in the <unk>
Now, all of this --   remember, all of this happens in less than a <unk> is what takes it to travel light.
But this video is 10 billion times slower so that you can see light in motion.
Coca-Cola is not going to do this research.  <unk> a lot of things in this <unk> <unk> this information to show what's going on.
The pulse, our <unk> comes into the bottle with a pack of photons which starts <unk> and inside, it starts to <unk>
Part of the light gets <unk> it goes to the table, and we started seeing these <unk>
Many of the photons finally come to the lid and then explode in various directions.
As you can see, there's a air bubble that bounce inside the inside.
In that time, the waves travel around the table and because of the <unk> of the top you see in the bottom of the bottle, after several boxes, that the <unk> <unk>
Now, if you take a common <unk> <unk> and we make it run the same distance and you see it in slow down to about 10 billion times, how much they think it would take us to sit on to see that film?
One day? A week? Actually, a whole year.
It would be a very boring movie --  of a <unk> <unk>
And how about testing it with <unk> nature.
You can see the waves that were <unk> from the table, the tomato <unk>
It's like throwing a stone on a pond.
It's the way nature paints a picture, I thought of a <unk> at the time, but of course, our eyes see a full <unk>
But if you look at more and more this <unk> you'll notice that, as light hits the <unk> are still bright.
Why? Because the tomato is <unk> and the light bounce into its inside, and it comes back after several <unk> of a second.
In the future, when this <unk> is in your mobile phones, they're going to be able to go to the supermarket and verify if the fruit is grown without having to <unk>
So what do we create this camera at school?"
As photographers, you know, if you take a <unk> photo, it comes very little light.
But we'll go to a billion times faster than the shortest end, so I just get into some light.
We sent that <unk> that package of photons, millions of times, and we recorded over and over again with a very <unk> <unk> we took those data <unk> and the <unk> <unk> to create those <unk> that I showed you.
We can take all of those data in raw and <unk>
Superman can fly.
Other heroes can become invisible, they can become common.
And if a new power of a <unk> future would allow him to see after the <unk>
The idea is that we could throw some light on the door, <unk> go into the room, a part is going to reflect on the door, and from there to the camera.
Where we could extract those multiple light <unk>
It's not science fiction. We already built it.
On the left, it's our <unk>
Behind the wall is a <unk> and <unk> the light on the door.
After the publication of our article in Nature <unk>
And interestingly, a small fraction of the photons is going to go back to the camera, but interestingly, in a slightly different time.
And as we have a camera that works that fast, our <unk> has unique capability.
It has very good time resolution, and it can look at the world at the speed of light.
So we know the distances up to the door, and also to the hidden objects, but we don't know what extent it is that it corresponds to that distance.
So project a laser can record a <unk> picture that you see on the screen, really doesn't make any sense.
But we will take lots of images like this, dozens of images, the <unk> and we're going to try to analyze the multiple <unk> of light, and with that, we can see the object <unk>
Can we see it in <unk>
This is our rebuilding it.
We have things to explore before we get this out of the laboratory, but in the future, we could create cars that <unk> collisions with what's going on the back of the curve.
Or we could find survivors in dangerous conditions, looking at light reflected through open windows.
Or we could build <unk> that can be able to see inside the body through <unk> and the same thing for <unk>
But of course, because of the tissue and the blood -- this is quite difficult, so this is actually a request to scientists to start thinking about <unk> as a new <unk> of visualization to solve the problems of building health in the next generation.
So <unk> <unk> himself a scientist, turned science into art, an art of <unk>
I realized that all the <unk> of data that we collect is not just for scientific visualizations but we can see it.
We create a new form of computer photography with slow motion and <unk>
And look at those <unk> remember, the time between one of those waves is just a <unk> of a second.
But here's a lot of fun.
If you look at the waves below the <unk> these are leaving us.
The waves should move towards us.
What happens here?
It turns out, as we are recording almost at the speed of light, we have strange <unk> Einstein would have loved to see this picture.
The order that events occur in the world sometimes appears to be invested in the camera.
<unk> the corresponding loss of space and time, we can fix this <unk>
It's time. Thank you.
Hi. This is my mobile phone.
A mobile phone can <unk> your life, and gives you the individual freedom.
With a mobile phone, a crime crime in Syria.
With a mobile phone, you can tweet a message and start a protest in Egypt.
With a mobile phone you can record a song, and move it into <unk> and get famous.
This is all possible with a cell phone.
I'm an <unk> in 1984 and I live in the city of <unk>
Let's go back to that moment to this city.
So here you can see how hundreds of thousands of people <unk> in search of a change.
This is the fall of 1989. Imagine if all of these people gathering that <unk> for a change, they had a cell phone in your pocket.
Who has a mobile phone here?
<unk>
Raise your <unk>
<unk> a Android, a Blackberry, wow!
It's a lot. Almost everyone has a cell phone.
But today I'm going to talk about me, my mobile, and how I changed life.
I'm going to talk about this.
These are 35 <unk> information lines.
<unk> data.
Why is that information there?
Because in the summer of 2006, the E.U. Commission presented a <unk>
<unk> <unk> of <unk>
This directive says that every single phone company, European company, every single Internet vendor has to store a wide range of information from the customers.
Who calls who. Who sends an email to <unk>
Who sends it a text to <unk>
And if we use the mobile phone, where we are.
All of this information is stored for at least six months, and two years, in your phone company, or your <unk>
And in all Europe, people stood up and said, "We don't want this."
They said they didn't want this <unk>
We want the <unk> in the digital age, and we don't want the phone carriers and the Internet providers, all this information about us.
There were lawyers, journalists, priests, everybody said, "We don't want this."
And here you can see about 10,000 people who came out to the streets in Berlin and they said, <unk> not <unk>
And some of them even said this would be <unk> 2.0.
<unk> was the secret police of Germany.
And I also asked me if this really really works.
Can you store all this information about us?
Every time the <unk>
So I asked my phone -- <unk> <unk> who at that time was the largest phone company in Germany, that please give me all the information you had about me.
I asked them once, and I went back to me, and I didn't get a particular answer, and it was all <unk>
But then I said, I want to have this information because you're <unk> my life.
So I decided to <unk> a <unk> because I wanted to have this information.
But <unk> <unk> said no, we're not going to give you this information.
At the end of it, you all agree.
<unk> demand and they would send me the information that I <unk>
Meanwhile, the Veterans' Court failed the <unk> for the German law of the E.U.
So I got this ugly thing about brown <unk>
And in the CD there was this.
Thirty and five thousand <unk> 30 lines of information.
At the beginning I saw it, and I said, well, it's an enormous file. OK.
But after a while, I realized that it's my life.
There are six months of my life in this file.
It was a little bit <unk> what should I do with that?
Because you can see where I am, where the night, what am I doing.
But then I said, I want this <unk> information.
I want to make it public.
Because I want to show people what the retention retention means.
So together with <unk> <unk> and Open City, it did this.
This is a <unk> visualization of my life.
You can zoom in and zoom in, go back and forward.
You can see every step I do.
And you can see how I'm going to <unk> on the train to <unk> and how often I call the way.
This is all possible with this information.
That gives a bit of fear.
But it's not only about me.
It's about all of us.
First, there are things like, I call my wife and she calls me a couple of times.
Then they call me some friends and they call each other.
And then you call the other, and the other one, and we end up with this big communication network.
You can see how your people communicate with each other, what time do you call each other, how to sleep.
You can see this stuff.
You can see the centers, the leaders of the group.
If you have access to this information, you can see what the society is.
If you have access to this information, you can control your society.
This is a model for countries like China and Iran.
This is a model to study the shape of your society, because you know who talks to whom, who sends an email to who, all this is possible if you have access to this information.
And this information is stored at least six months in Europe, and even two years.
As I said at the beginning, imagine if all these people on the streets of Berlin, in the fall of 1989, they had a cell phone in our pocket.
And the <unk> had known who I was involved in this protest, and if the <unk> had known who the leaders were, this would never have happened.
The fall of the Berlin Wall may never have happened.
And as a result, the <unk> of <unk>
Because today, the state agencies and companies want to store as much information from us as possible in and out of the web.
They want to have the possibility to follow our lives and they want to <unk> them forever.
But <unk> and living in the digital age is not a contradiction.
But today you have to fight for <unk>
You have to fight for that every day.
When you come home to your friends that privacy is a 21st-century value of the 21st century and it's not just fashion.
When you go home to your <unk> that just because business and city agencies can get some information, they don't have to do it.
And if you don't believe me, ask your phone company, what do you store from you.
So in the future, every time you use your cell phones to remind you to remember that they have to fight for the <unk> in the digital era.
Thank you.
Hello, <unk> what happens?
It's not enough.
Hello, <unk> what happens?
I call myself <unk> <unk> and I'm not <unk> but I know the doctor that brought me to the world.
<unk> my mom six times in six different directions, <unk> to the poor of me in the process.

The P. C. It's not genetics.
It's not <unk> and it can be <unk>
No one <unk> the uterus of my mom and not <unk> because my parents were brothers, although they are.
It just goes through accidents, like the one that I got at birth.
Now, I'm going to give you, I'm not a <unk> and I don't want any of the people in the world.
It feels bad for me, because at some point of life, they wish to be disabled.
We go for a walk.
Christmas <unk> they're in the commercial mall, drive in circles in a parking lot and what do you see?
16 empty places for disabled.
And they think, "God, I can be at least a little <unk>
And also, I tell you, I have 99 problems, and the P. C. It's just one of them.
There was a <unk> of the <unk> I would win the gold medal.

I'm in Yellowstone <unk> in New Jersey.
I always loved my neighborhood and my illness had the same <unk>
I also love that if I wanted to walk from my home to New York, I might.
Many people with cerebral palsy, but my parents don't believe in <unk>
The mantra of my father was, "You can <unk> <unk> <unk>
If my three older sisters <unk> I <unk>
If my three older sisters were going to public school, my parents went to the school system and <unk> that I also went, and if we didn't take all the ultimate story -- all the top of my mother.
My father taught me how to walk five years putting my <unk> on his feet and just walking.
Another approach I used was to hang on a dollar in front of me to make it <unk>
The <unk> that I carry inside was very strong, and ...
Yeah. The first day in the child kindergarten was walking like a <unk> <unk> which has gotten many <unk>
Growing up, there was only six Arabs in my city, and they were all of the family.
Now there are 20 <unk> and they're still all in the family.  I think nobody realized we weren't <unk>
This was before 9/11, and that politicians would think appropriate to use <unk> to <unk> as a campaign <unk>
The people I grew up with no problems with my faith.
But it seemed to be <unk> a lot of starvation in the <unk>
I was telling them that he had enough fat to live three months without eating, so he <unk> the dawn at sunset it's very easy.
<unk> <unk> in <unk>
Yes, in <unk> It's crazy.  My parents couldn't afford the physical therapy -- so I sent me to the dance school.
I learned to dance with <unk> or whatever I can walk with <unk>
I'm from New Jersey, and there we want to be <unk> so if my friends used <unk> I would too.
And when my friends were going to spend a summer vacation on the coast of Jersey, I wasn't going.
I spent my summers in a war zone, because my parents were afraid if we're not going to go back to Palestine all the <unk> <unk> us in <unk>
On summer holidays often my father was trying to <unk> so I was drinking milk from <unk> and put me <unk> on the back, and I would remember the water <unk> and I remember the water <unk> my eyes and I was thinking, <unk> <unk>
But the <unk> cure was the yoga.
I have to say it's very boring, but before you do yoga it was a <unk> comedian that you could not stand up with <unk> <unk>
And now I can see it in the head.
My parents <unk> this idea that I could do anything, that no dream was impossible, and my dream was to be in <unk> Hospital was <unk>
I went to college through the positive discrimination, and I got a fellowship for the University of Arizona, which was in all the <unk>
It was like the <unk> pet <unk>
Everybody <unk>
I did all the tasks of the least smart, I took the top note in my classroom, and also in their classes.
Every time I did a scene of the glass zoo my <unk> teachers.
But I never got a role.
Finally, in my last year, the <unk> decided to make a work called <unk> very slow in Jackson.
It's a work of a girl with cerebral palsy,
I was a girl with cerebral palsy,
So I started screaming at the four <unk> At the end will have a <unk>
I have <unk> <unk>
At the end of it, we finally <unk>
Thank God <unk> I'm <unk>
I didn't get the paper.  You gave it to <unk> Brown.
I went to <unk> running at the head of the theater theater director crying as if someone had killed my cat, to ask him why and she told me that because they believed it could not make the stunt stunts
And I said, <unk> if I can't do the stunt stunts you can't do the <unk>
It was a paper that he literally was born and gave an actor without brain <unk>
College was imitating my life.
Hollywood has a <unk> story of <unk> actors <unk>
By <unk> I went back home, and my first tour tour, was like extra in a <unk>
My dream came true.
And I knew that it would be <unk> to <unk> friend <unk> friend <unk>
Instead, I stayed there as a <unk> and I didn't see it more than the <unk> and it was clear to me that the principals were not <unk> <unk> <unk> with disabilities.
Just <unk> to perfect people.
But there were exceptions to the rule.
I grew up watching <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and all these women had one thing in common: They were <unk>
So I made myself <unk>
In my first tour, I took wonderful comics from New York to New Jersey, and I will never forget the face of the first comedian that led to when he fell at high speed on the New Jersey <unk> with a driver that had cerebral <unk>
I worked in clubs across the United States, and also in Arabic.
Some people say I'm the first <unk> of the Arab world.
I never like to reclaim the first place, but I know you have never heard that little <unk> that is saying that women are not fun, and they find it very fun.
In 2003, my <unk> brother and father, Dean <unk> and I launched the <unk> <unk> New York City <unk> in New York, now in his 10 year.
Our goal was to change the negative image of the <unk> in the media and the one time reminding the <unk> to <unk> and Arabic is not <unk>
<unk> to the Arab was much easier to fight against the challenge of stigma in disability.
My great opportunity came in 2010.
I was as invited to the news program by wire, and it has Keith <unk>
I walked out as if I went to a Harvard dance, I was <unk> to a study and sat me in a <unk>
I looked at the director and I said, <unk> you can give me another <unk>
She looked at me and said, <unk> four, three, <unk>
And we were in <unk>
So I hold onto the teacher's desk to not get out of the screen during the <unk> and when I finished the interview, I was <unk>
In order I had my opportunity and <unk> I knew I wouldn't come back to me.
But not only Mr. <unk> went back to <unk> but I was just like I got a full-time <unk> and hit my chair.
Something fun that I learned in direct with Keith <unk> was that people on the Internet are <unk>
It is said that kids are <unk> but they never fall out of me and no older girl.
All of a sudden, my Internet disability, turned to <unk>
I went online online online, like, "Why do you <unk>
"It's <unk>
And my favorite, <unk> <unk>
What does it have?
We really should be praying for it.
A <unk> suggested even I would add my disability to my <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
<unk> is as visual as race.
If somebody in a wheelchair can't do <unk> then you can't make someone in a wheelchair.
<unk> are the -- Yeah, <unk> man.
<unk> are the largest minority of the world, and the most <unk> in the world of entertainment.
The doctors said that not <unk> but I'm here in front of you.
However, I've grown up with media media, I don't think it <unk>
I hope that together we can create more positive images of disability in media and everyday life.
Maybe if there were more positive images, that would be less hatred on the Internet.
Or maybe not.
Maybe we still need the whole society to teach our children.
My <unk> journey has led me to very spectacular places.
I got to <unk> by the red carpet from the <unk> Susan <unk> and the famous <unk> <unk>
I got to act on a film with Adam <unk> and work with my <unk> the incredible Dave <unk>
<unk> the Arab world, "The Arabs have become <unk>
I was <unk> in representation of the great state of New Jersey in the <unk> of 2008.
And I founded "The <unk> of <unk> a charity to give young children refugee children -- a minuscule part of what my parents <unk>
It was the only time my father saw me act live, and I do this talk to his memory.
<unk> in peace, <unk>
I call myself <unk> <unk> and if I can, you can.
I'd like to tell you a story about a young town.
I don't know his name, but I know his story.
She lives in a small town in the South <unk>
This town is near <unk>
<unk> drives the small town to poverty and on the verge of <unk>
No one for him there, it goes to the big city, in this case, <unk> the capital of Somalia.
When it comes there, there is no opportunities, no job, no <unk>
He just lived in a tent in the city outside of <unk>
After maybe a year I got nothing.
One day he was offered a man who offers to take him to <unk> after dinner, to <unk>
He meets a group of <unk> that gives you a break.
It gets a little bit of money to get new clothes, money to send home, your family.
They show a young guy.
They finally got home.
It starts a new life.
It has a goal of life.
A beautiful day in <unk> under a blue sky, <unk> a car bomb.
That young boy in that small town with dreams of the great city was <unk> <unk> and that dynamic group of people were to <unk> a connected terrorist organization to al Qaeda.
So how do the story of a small people who are trying to fulfill his dreams in the city end with him <unk>
He was waiting for him.
I was waiting for an opportunity, hoping to start his future, waiting for a future perspective, and this was the first thing that arrived.
This was the first thing that he pulled out of what we call "the <unk> <unk>
And their story is repeated on urban centers around the world.
It's the story of the <unk> young urban urban riots that <unk> riots in <unk> <unk> riots in London, looking for something beyond <unk> <unk>
For the young people, the promise of the city, the great dream of city is the opportunity for jobs -- in well-being, but young people are not participating in the prosperity of their cities.
It's often the youth that suffer from higher rates of unemployment.
By 2030, three of five people living in cities are under 18 years.
If we don't include young people in the growth of our cities, if they don't give them opportunities -- the story of the <unk> the door of access to terrorism, the door of access to violence, to <unk> will be the story of cities 2.0.
And in my hometown of birth, <unk> 70 percent of the young people are <unk>
70 percent don't work, it's not going to school.
They don't do pretty much anything.
I went back last month, and I went to visit <unk> Hospital the hospital where I was born.
I remember being in front of that hospital to <unk> thinking, and if I had never gone?
And if I had seen myself forced to be in that same <unk> <unk>
I would have become <unk>
I'm not really sure about the answer.
The reason I was in <unk> that month was actually to hold a young leaders at a business <unk>
<unk> to some successful <unk> <unk>
We sat down and we had a rain of ideas about solutions to the great challenges facing the city.
One of the young people in the room was <unk>
He was at the University of <unk> <unk>
There were no job, no opportunities.
I remember when he said to me, because he was a graduate graduate student, <unk> <unk> was the perfect perfect white for <unk> and other terrorists, to be <unk>
They were looking for people like it.
But this story takes a different path.
In <unk> the biggest hurdle to reach from point A to B is the streets.
<unk> years of civil war have completely destroyed the traffic system, and a motorcycle can be the easiest way to <unk>
<unk> saw an opportunity and <unk>
He started a <unk> company.
It began <unk> <unk> to local residents who normally couldn't afford them.
I bought 10 <unk> with the help of his family and friends, and his dream is at some point to expand to hundreds of motorcycles over the next three years.
Why is this story?
What makes this story different?
I think their ability to identify and leverage a new opportunity.
It's the corporate spirit, and I think the spirit spirit may be the most powerful tool against <unk> <unk>
Tell young people to be the creators of the economic opportunities that are looking for so <unk>
And you can train young people to be entrepreneurs.
I want to talk to you about a young man who attended one of my meetings, Mohamed <unk> a <unk>
I was <unk> to train some of the young people at the summit of business initiative and how to be innovative and how to create a culture of business work.
In fact, it's the first <unk> that <unk> has seen in more than 22 years, and until Mohamed arrived, if Mohamed did you wanted flowers for your <unk> <unk> we were from plastic from <unk>
If you went to somebody, "When did you see the last time you saw <unk>
For those who grew up during the civil war, the answer would be <unk>
So Mohamed saw an opportunity.
It started a company of <unk> and <unk> design.
He created a farm outside of <unk> and he started growing <unk> and <unk> who said, could survive the hard climate of <unk>
And it began the delivery of flowers for weddings to create gardens in the houses, and the companies in the city, and now is working on creating the first public park in <unk> in 22 years.
There are no public parks in <unk>
She wants to create a space where the families, the young people, they can go together, and, as he says, sniff pink <unk>
By the way, he is not <unk> because they use lots of water.
So the first step is to inspire young people, and in that room, the presence of Mohamed had a really profound impact on young people.
They had never thought about starting a business.
They had thought about working for an NGO, working for government, but their story, their innovation, really had a strong impact on them.
They forced them to look at their city as a place of opportunity.
encouraged me to believe that they could be entrepreneurs, they could be <unk> out of it.
By the end of the day, they already had innovative solutions for some of the biggest challenges facing the city.
<unk> business solutions for local problems.
So, inspiring young people and creating a culture of entrepreneurial spirit is really a big step, but young people need capital to make their ideas happen.
They need expertise and guidance to <unk> and set out their businesses.
<unk> young people with the resources that they need, <unk> the support that they need to go from conception and create <unk> for the urban growth.
For me, spirit spirit is something more than starting a business.
It's creating a social impact.
Mohamed is not simply selling flowers.
I think it's selling hope.
Their Park. That's how it calls it when it is created, it will transform the way people see their city.
<unk> I hired kids from the street to help rent and keep <unk> for him.
He gave them the opportunity to escape <unk> <unk> <unk>
These young entrepreneurs who are having a tremendous impact on their cities.
So my suggestion is to become young in entrepreneurs, <unk> and eating their innovation <unk> and they have more stories about flowers and Parks of the Peace <unk> and <unk> <unk>
Thank you.
I was about 10 years and I went to <unk> with my dad in the <unk> <unk> a <unk> area north of New York.
It was a beautiful day.
The forest <unk>
The sun would make the leaves <unk> like a <unk> and not to be the path that we could almost imagine that we were the first human beings on top of that land.
We got to our camp.
It was a shed in a <unk> with sight to a beautiful lake lake when I discovered something horrible.
Behind the <unk> there was a <unk> of about four square meters with apple hearts and <unk> <unk> and old <unk>
And I was <unk> I was very angry and incredibly <unk>
The <unk> who were too lazy to get what they were <unk> who thought he was going to clean their <unk>
That question followed with me, and he was <unk> a little bit.
Who clean our <unk>
No matter how to <unk> or where to <unk> the <unk> who clean our trash in <unk>
Who clean up our trash in Rio or in Paris or <unk>
Here in New York, the Department of <unk> clean our trash, which is why 11 thousand tons of waste and 2,000 tons of <unk> products every day.
I wanted to know people as individuals.
I wanted to understand who makes that work.
What is it like to use the uniform and take that <unk>
So I started a research project with them.
I traveled on the trucks and walked through his pathways, and I interviewed people in offices and facilities around the city, and I learned a lot, but it was still a <unk>
I needed a lot more.
So I began to work like garbage <unk>
Now I wouldn't just travel in the trucks.
And <unk> mechanical <unk> and <unk>
It was a remarkable privilege and an amazing learning.
They all ask about the smell.
It's there, but it's not as prevalent as you believe, and in the days that it's very strong, you get it quickly.
It costs a lot to get used to weight.
I met people who had worked on it for several years and their bodies kept <unk> the weight of getting over their body tons of garbage every week.
There's also the danger.
According to the Bureau of <unk> <unk> <unk> is one of the ten <unk> <unk> in the country, and I learned the reason.
You're going out and moving into traffic all day and pass everyone around you.
They just want to <unk> so in general, the driver is not paying attention.
That's really bad for the <unk>
And the trash is also full of dangers that often fall off the truck and make terrible damage to the truck.
I also learned about the relentless trash.
When you get out of the <unk> and you see a city from the back of the truck, you get to understand that the garbage is as a force of nature itself.
Never let come.
It's also like a breathing form or circulation.
It should always be in motion.
And the stigma.
It seems to me that stigma is especially ironic because I believe that <unk> are the most important labor in the streets of the city, for three reasons.
They are the first <unk> of public health.
If you don't get rid of the waste of the efficient and effective form every day, this starts <unk> of your container and its dangers inherent to us in very real ways.
<unk> that we had controlled for decades and centuries <unk> and start <unk>
The economy needs it.
If we can't get rid of the old thing, we don't have a space for what the economic engines begin to fail when it's in danger consumption.
I'm not advocating for capitalism, just to point your relationship.
And then there is what I call our average <unk>
So I mean just the speed that we used to move in the <unk> time.
We usually have no <unk> we can't clean up and we take our cup of coffee, our bag of <unk> our water bottle.
We use, the <unk> we forget about them, because we know there is a work force on the other side that would take care of it.
So today, I want to suggest to you a couple of ways of thinking about waste waste that perhaps helps to reduce the stigma and <unk> in that conversation about how to design a sustainable and human city.
Her job, I think, is almost <unk>
They're on the street every day, <unk>
They use a uniform in a lot of cities.
Do you know when they <unk>
And their work allows us to do our own.
They're almost a relief.
The flow that keeps us safely from ourselves, our own <unk> our <unk> and that flow always must stay in one way or another.
One day after September 11, 2001, I heard the <unk> of a <unk> collection truck on the street, grabbed my little son, and he went back the stairs and he went back the stairs and there was a man doing his journey of recycled paper as I did all the <unk>
And I tried to thank you for doing this particular day, but I started crying.
And he looked at me and just <unk> and said, "We're going to be okay.
We're going to be OK."
Shortly after that, I started to look at the garbage collection and I went back to see that man.
It's called <unk> we worked together and we made good friends.
I want to believe that <unk> was right.
We're going to be okay.
But in our efforts by <unk> the way we exist on this planet as a species -- we have to include and keep all the costs, even the real human cost of labor labor.
<unk> waste what we think about when we are talking about garbage represent three percent of the <unk>
It's a remarkable <unk>
So in the flow of their days, and in their lives, the next one that you see someone whose job is to clean up the garbage of you, <unk> a moment to <unk>
<unk> a moment to tell you thank you.
My work focuses on the connection to thinking about our community life -- making part of the environment where architecture is naturally born from the local and local traditions.
Today, I brought up with two recent projects like this.
Both projects are located in emerging countries, one in Ethiopia and the other in Tunisia.
And they also share the fact that different analysis from different perspectives become an essential part of the final piece of architecture.
The first example started with an invitation to design a shopping center in the capital of Ethiopia, Addis Ababa <unk>
This is the kind of construction that they showed us as an example, and my team and me about what we had to design design.
At first, the first thing I thought was, "I want to go out <unk>
After seeing some of these buildings there are many in the city, we realized that there are three important aspects to <unk>
In principle, these buildings are almost empty because they have very large stores where people can't afford to buy things.
Second, you need to employ a lot of energy because of the <unk> it generates heat into the inside, so you need a lot of <unk>
In a city where this should not happen because it's a temperate weather that goes from 20 to 25 degrees during the whole year.
And thirdly, what it looks like is nothing to do with Africa and in Ethiopia.
It's a pity for a very rich place in culture and traditions.
In our first visit to Ethiopia, I was really <unk> by the old market that is this structure of open air where thousands of people, go and buy things every day to small <unk>
There is also that idea of using public space to generate external activity.
So I thought, that was what I really wanted to design, not a commercial center.
But the question was how to build a new building, from several stories by applying these principles.
The next challenge was presented to <unk> the site, which is located in a very much growth zone, where much of the buildings that we now see in the image, not even existed.
And it's also between two parallel streets that don't communicate in a hundred meters.
So the first thing we did was to create a connection between these two streets, linking all the <unk> of the building.
And this spreads from a <unk> <unk> that creates a space to open air in the building that <unk> in its own way, the sun and rain.
And around this space we have applied the idea of the market with small businesses, that changes on each floor because of the form of space.
I also thought, how to close the building?
I wanted to find a solution that would be <unk> to the local climate conditions.
And I began to think of a similar tissue to a concrete shell, <unk> to allow the air <unk> and also from light, but in a <unk> way.
And then we were inspired by these beautiful buttons in the <unk>
They have properties of fractal geometry and this helped me model <unk>
We're building that with these little <unk> parts, which are the windows that leave the air and light in a way the inside of the building.
This is <unk> with these little colors of colors that use the light inside the building to illuminate the building at night.
With these ideas not easy to convince developers because they thought, "That's not a commercial center -- it wasn't what they <unk>
But ultimately we realized that this market idea was to be much more profitable than the commercial center -- because at the end of the bank there were more local to sell.
And also the idea of the facade was so much cheaper -- not only because of the material compared to the glass, but also because it wasn't necessary to have air conditioning.
So we get certain savings in the budget that we use to implement the project.
The first thing was to think about how to get the energy <unk> for the building in a city in which electricity is almost every day.
So we got a big advantage by putting it on the roof.
And then under those panels we think about the ceiling as a new public space with areas of meeting and bars that would create this <unk> <unk>
And these <unk> on the roof, which are collecting water for inner <unk>
It's supposed to be the beginning of the next year, because we go through the fifth floor of construction.
The second example is a master plan of 2,000 apartments and services in the city of Tunisia.
And to do a project so big, the biggest thing that I have designed, I needed not just understanding the city of Tunisia, but also its environment, its tradition and culture.
During that analysis I put special attention on the <unk> a <unk> structure that was surrounded by a wall with twelve percent doors of access to <unk>
When I went to the place, the first design operation, that we did was to expand existing streets -- creating 12 early blocks in size and features that there are in Barcelona and other cities in Europe with these <unk>
In addition to that, we pick up some strategic dots in relation to the idea of the doors with straight lines, and this altered the initial model.
And the last operation was to think of the cell, the little cell of the project, like an essential part of the master plan.
I thought, what would be the best orientation for an apartment in the <unk>
And it's <unk> because it creates a thermal difference between both sides of the house and therefore a natural ventilation.
So <unk> a scheme that ensures that most of the apartments are perfectly <unk> in that direction.
And this is the result that it's almost like a combination of the European block and the Arab city.
It has these <unk> <unk> and then in the low plant we have all the connections to the pedestrians.
And it also responds to local norms that set up a greater density on higher levels and a lower density in the plant.
And it also reinforces this idea of the doors.
The roof, which is my favorite space of the project is almost like <unk> to the community that was busy building space.
It's where all the neighbors, can go up and <unk> and make activities, like running a <unk> race in the morning, or jump from a building to another.
These two examples, have a common approach in the design process.
And also, they're in emerging countries, where you can see cities literally growing.
In these cities, the impact of architecture in people's lives changes local communities and local economies at the same pace growing buildings.
For this reason, I see even more important to look at architecture looking for simple solutions, but <unk> that improves the relationship between the community and the environment, and that they have as objective to connect nature with people.
Thank you very much.
When I was eight years, a new girl joined our class. It was so remarkable, as you see all the new girls.
I had huge amounts of bright hair, and a little <unk> <unk> of nice <unk> was <unk> for the capitals of the states, very good for <unk>
I ended up that year and I was full of his, until I <unk> my sinister plan.
One day I stayed a time after I was coming out of the school, I was a little afternoon, and I hid in the <unk> <unk>
When the coast was <unk> I walked into the classroom, I took out the table of my master's grades.
And then I did.
I put in the ratings of my <unk> just a little bit, just a few <unk>
All the <unk>  And I set up to return the book to the <unk> but to see, some of my other partners had very good notes as well.
So in a <unk> <unk> the notes around the world, without any imagination.
I put every single rows of <unk> and myself in a row in the way -- just by being there, because it <unk>
I'm still surprising what I did.
I don't understand how the whole idea.
I don't understand why I felt well doing it.
I felt important.
I don't understand why I never <unk>
It was all <unk>
I never <unk>
But above all, I was struck by the reason why I was bothered by this little girl that was so small to be so good at <unk>
I <unk> the jealousy.
They're so <unk> and so <unk>
We know that babies suffer from jealousy.
Also, the primates. The birds are <unk> are very <unk>
We know that <unk> are the number one cause of <unk>
And yet, I've never seen a study that <unk> the loneliness, or the long duration or the sadness.
So I have to go to the fiction, because novels are like the lab that we study <unk> in all of their possible shapes.
In fact, I don't know if it's an exaggeration to say that if there was no literature. I would have no literature.
Well, there would be no <unk> I wouldn't have <unk>
There was no king <unk> or <unk> and <unk>
I wouldn't have Shakespeare.
I put your head lists from high school, because we would be losing "The <unk> and the <unk> would have no <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk>
Without it, there's no <unk> I know it's fashionable to say that <unk> has the answers to everything, and in terms of jealousy, almost they have all of them.
This year they meet 100 years of his masterpiece, "In the <unk> of <unk> the most <unk> study of sexual <unk> and also the ordinary <unk> of mine, all that we could have.  And thinking about <unk> we have the <unk> details -- right?
We think of a child trying to reconcile sleep.
We think about a <unk> <unk> in <unk>
We forgot how hard that picture.
We forgot how relentless it is.
I mean, it is books that Virginia <unk> said they were as tough as <unk>
I don't know what the cat <unk> is, but we assume it's <unk>
Let's see why they go so well together, the novel and the <unk> the <unk> and <unk>
It's going to be very obvious how it will be reduced to the person, to their desire, to their <unk> are a very <unk> base.
I don't know. I think we got very close to the bone, when we think about what happens when we feel jealousy.
When we feel precisely we tell ourselves a story.
A story about other people, and those stories make us feel terrible because they're designed to make us feel bad.
Being <unk> and audience, we know exactly what details of <unk> to <unk> the knife isn't it?
The <unk> make us all <unk> <unk> and that is something that they were trying to understand.
Everything that she does to give me pleasure could give you pleasure to another, maybe now."
And it starts to say to himself that story, and since then, <unk> says that every fresh <unk> that <unk> detects in his lover, adds to his collection of instruments of torture in their private camera.
You have to admit that <unk> and <unk> were notoriously <unk>
You know, <unk> <unk> would have to leave the country, if they wanted to break up with it.
But you don't have to be so <unk> to recognize that it's hard work. Right?
<unk> are <unk>
It's an emotion emotion. You have to <unk>
And how are the <unk>
<unk> are <unk> of information.
<unk> use the details.
<unk> like the great amounts of bright hair and the cute little <unk> <unk>
The <unk> were <unk>
That's why Instagram is so successful --  <unk> links the <unk> language with the jealousy.
And when <unk> is in his fingertips, as soon listening to behind the doors and <unk> to the <unk> of his lover -- so it defends those behaviors.
He says, "Look, I know I know this is <unk> but it's not different from the interpretation of an old text or looking at a <unk>
He says, "They're really scientific research with real value.
<unk> is trying to prove that <unk> look <unk> and they make us seem <unk> but in their <unk> they're search for knowledge, search of knowledge -- really painful -- in fact, what to <unk> <unk> the truth better.
The pain, <unk> <unk> These were the <unk> wisdom.
He says, "A woman who we need, that makes us suffer, causes ourselves to us a range of much more profound and vital feelings that a wise man can tell us.
It's telling us that we're going to go for <unk> women.
No. I think he's trying to say that <unk> are reveal ourselves.
And there is some other emotion that makes us <unk> this particular way?
There is some other excitement to us, our <unk> our horrible ambition and our <unk>
Any other emotion that teaches us to look at the intensity so <unk>
Freud would write about this later.
One day, Freud was visited by a young woman who was being used by the idea that his woman was <unk>
And Freud said that there was something strange about that man that doesn't fit in what his wife.
Well, she was <unk> everybody knew it.
The poor creature was <unk> with no cause.
But he was looking for things that he did his wife, <unk> <unk> behaviors.
<unk> <unk> or don't have a man?
Freud said that the man was becoming the <unk> of the unconscious of his wife.
<unk> are very good at this.
<unk> describe very well how the <unk> are making us look at intensity but accurately.
In fact, the more intensely <unk> we are more to become residents of fantasy.
And for this reason, I think, <unk> lead us to do violent acts or illegal.
<unk> are driving us to behave in totally <unk> ways.
Now I'm thinking about me for eight years, I think, <unk> but I'm also thinking about this story that I heard in the news.
A woman from Michigan was 52 years old was captured by having created a fake account on Facebook since he was sent messages <unk> awful <unk> for a year.
For one year.
She was trying to <unk> the new girlfriend of his former boyfriend. I have to confess that when or this, I reacted to <unk>
Because let's be realistic.
What's massive, even though <unk> creativity. Right?
It's like <unk>
Like a Patricia Patricia <unk>
<unk> is one of my favorites.
She's a brilliant and brilliant character of American literature.
This is the author of <unk> in a <unk> and "The <unk> Mr. <unk> books that try to make their own <unk> and once we are in the sphere, in the kingdom of explaining the membrane that separates what might be, can be <unk> in a second.
Take Tom <unk> his most famous character.
Tom <unk> goes from <unk> or wanting what you have to be <unk> from your self and <unk> what you ever <unk> and it's under the floor <unk> to your name, and it takes your rings, <unk> your bank accounts.
It's a way.
But what do we do? We can't take the route of Tom <unk>
I can't give you <unk> all the world, as well as I wanted to.
It's a shame, because we live in times of envy.
We live in times of jealousy.
That is, we are good human networks, where the currency is <unk> right?
<unk> shows <unk> I'm not safe.
So we're going to do what the characters always do when they're not sure, when they're in front of a mystery.
Let's go to the <unk> of Baker Street and ask for <unk> <unk>
When people think about <unk> they think of the curse of Professor <unk> in Professor <unk> that criminal.
But I always favorite to <unk> <unk> <unk> the <unk> face of <unk> <unk> who needs <unk> <unk> needs the genius of <unk> but <unk>
Oh, this sounds so <unk>
<unk> needs its help, but <unk> and <unk> with <unk> in each of the puzzles.
But as they work together, something starts to change, and finally in "The <unk> <unk> once you <unk> <unk> <unk> to all of the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and says, "We're not <unk> Mr. <unk>
We're proud of <unk>
And he tells him that there's no person in <unk> <unk> who wouldn't want to <unk> your hand.
It's one of the times that we see <unk> <unk> in history. I think this is very emotional. That scene is also mysterious, right?
It seems to treat <unk> as a geometry, no excitement.
You know, in a minute <unk> the opposite side of <unk>
The next minute you are the same side.
Suddenly, <unk> is allowed to admire that idea of being the <unk>
It could still be that easy?
What if <unk> are really an issue of geometry, just a question of where we allow us to be in relation to another?
Well, maybe we don't have to get rid of the greatness in the other.
We can <unk> with it.
But I like <unk>
So while we hope that happens, we remember that we have fiction to <unk>
Just fiction only <unk> jealousy.
fiction used to <unk> the invites to the table.
And look at what <unk> sweet <unk> the scary Tom <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
We're in excellent company.
Thank you.
We used to solve big problems.
On the 21st of July 21, Buzz Aldrin jumped out of the <unk> <unk> <unk> and went on top of the <unk> Sea.
Armstrong and <unk> were alone, but his presence in the gray surface was the culmination of a collective collective process.
The Apollo program was the largest in peace in American history.
To get to the moon, NASA spent about 180 billion dollars today, or four percent of the federal budget.
Apollo gave work for 400,000 people and asked 20,000 companies, universities and government agencies.
<unk> people, including <unk> <unk>
But before the Apollo <unk> <unk> 24 men went to the moon.
<unk> walked on top of his surface, of which <unk> who kept death after Armstrong last year, is now the most <unk>
So why would you <unk>
They didn't have a lot of <unk> <unk> kilos of old rocks, and something that the 24 <unk> later, a new sense of <unk> and the fragility of our common home.
Why <unk> The cynical answer is that it was because President Kennedy wanted to demonstrate to the <unk> that this nation was better rockets.
But the words of the Kennedy words at the University of Rice <unk> they give us a better idea.
John F. <unk> Some ask, why is <unk>
Why turn it to our goal?
And you could also ask, why are the mountain <unk>
Thirty-five years ago, why would fly over the <unk>
Why is Rice Rice <unk>
We chose to go to the moon.
We chose to go to the moon.
We chose to go to the moon in this decade, and do other things, not because they're simple, but because they're hard.
Jason <unk> For the <unk> Apollo was not just a victory of the West on the Cold War.
In the time, the stronger emotion was <unk> to the transcendence of the powers of technology.
They were because it was something great to do.
The landing on the moon happened in a context of a long list of <unk>
The first half of the 20th century produced the assembly line, and the plane, penicillin and the vaccine for tuberculosis.
In the middle of the century, the <unk> and eliminated the smallpox.
Technology seemed like to own what Alvin <unk> in 1970, called <unk> <unk>
For most of the history of humanity, we couldn't go faster than a horse, or a ship with candle -- but in 1969, the crew of Apollo <unk> flew over 40,000 miles an hour.
In 1970, no human being gone to the moon.
No one has traveled faster than the crew of Apollo 10, and the optimism <unk> about the power of technology has been <unk> to see that problems that we imagined that the technology would solve how to go to Mars, create a clean energy, cure cancer, or feed the world population seem to be <unk>
I remember seeing the <unk> of Apollo 17.
I was five years old, and my mother told me that he doesn't go to the escape <unk> tube that <unk> Saturn <unk>
I knew that this would be the last <unk> mission, but I was absolutely sure I would get to see colonies on Mars.
So that takes. It happened to our ability to solve problems with <unk> has become a common place.
We heard this all the time.
We've heard it over the last two days here at TED.
It looks like the technologists have been <unk> and they have enriched them with trivial toys -- things like <unk> apps and social networks, or algorithms that speed up <unk>
There's nothing wrong with most of these things.
They've expanded and enriched our lives.
But we didn't solve the great problems of humanity.
What happened?
There's an <unk> explanation in Silicon Valley, that <unk> that have been created less ambitious companies than <unk> at Intel -- Microsoft, and Apple and <unk>
Silicon Valley says that markets are <unk> specifically, the incentives that venture capitalists offer to entrepreneurs.
Silicon Valley says that the risk of risk triggered the creation of ideas <unk> by the funding of <unk> problems, or even false problems.
But I don't think this explanation is good enough.
<unk> mostly what's wrong in <unk> Valley.
Even when the venture capitalists were on their high point without worrying about the risk, they were more than the risk of <unk> -- tiny investments that they could go out in 10 years.
<unk> have always had trouble investing in technology as energy as energy, which need tremendous capital and whose development is long-term and development is in the long run, have never invested in development of technologies that are meant to solve large problems because they don't have any commercial value.
No, the reasons why we cannot solve big problems are more complicated and profound.
Sometimes, we chose to solve big problems.
We could go to Mars if you <unk>
NASA has even designed a plan.
But to go to Mars it would require a political decision that was popular, and that will never happen.
We won't go to Mars because everybody thinks there are more important things to do on Earth.
Sometimes, we can't solve the big problems because the political systems fail.
Today, less than two percent of the world's energy consumption is from renewable energy sources like solar and wind and <unk> Less than two percent, and the reason is completely economic in it.
Coal and natural gas are cheaper than solar and wind, and oil is cheaper than the <unk>
We want sources of alternative energy to be able to compete at price.
Now, technologists, entrepreneurs and economists agree about what policies and international treaties the development of <unk> energy, <unk> a significant increase in research and energy development, and some kind of carbon control control.
But there is no hope in the political climate that we're going to see an energy policy of American or international treaties that reflect that consensus.
Sometimes, the big problems that seemed technological, it turns out to be.
We know for that long time that famines are a result of failure on the <unk>
But 30 years of research have taught us that famines are political crisis that affect the distribution of food.
Technology can improve things like crops and the systems for the storage and <unk> of food, but there will be famines of while there was poor governments.
Finally, big problems are sometimes <unk> a solution because we don't understand the problem.
The president told his declared war to cancer in 1971, but we soon discovered that there are many types of cancer, some <unk> to the treatment, and only in the last 10 years, they seem to have found effective treatments and viable.
<unk> problems are hard.
It's not true that we couldn't solve the problems with technology.
We can and we have -- but these four elements have to be <unk> political leaders and the population must want to solve the problem, institutions need to support <unk> it should really be about a <unk> problem.
The <unk> mission that has become something like this as a metaphor for the ability of technology to solve big problems, it is true with those <unk>
But it's a <unk> model in the future.
We're not in <unk>
There's no <unk> competition as in the Cold War, there is no politician like John Kennedy who <unk> the difficult and the dangerous, and there is no more popular science fiction system.
In general, to go to the moon turned out to be simple.
I was just three days.
And actually, I wasn't even <unk> any problem.
We're alone in our present, and the solutions of the future will be more difficult to get.
God knows that we are not missing.
Thank you very much.
Now, I'm going to talk about trust, and I'm going to start with the <unk> ideas that have about trust.
They're so common that they become <unk> of our society.
I think they're three.
The first is a <unk> there's been a huge decline of trust, is a very general belief,
The second is an <unk> we should have more confidence.
And the third one is a <unk> we should recover trust.
I think the <unk> and the task is poorly <unk>
What I'm going to try and tell you today is a different story about a <unk> a goal and a task that I think gives a more clear idea about that.
First of all, why do people think that trust has <unk>
And if I think about it about the basis of my own <unk> I don't know the answer.
I'm going to bow to think that there may be <unk> in some activities or institutions that could have increased in others.
I don't have that.
But I can use <unk> polls and the opinion polls are supposed to be the source of the belief that trust has decreased.
When you look at the opinion polls over time, there are no evidence of it.
I mean, the people who are <unk> 20 years ago, mostly journalists and politicians, are still <unk> the same <unk>
And the people who were very reliable about 20 years ago are still quite <unk> the nurses.
The rest of us in the middle, and by the way, the average citizen of the street is almost half of the street.
But this is really enough?
What <unk> polls are, of course, opinions.
What else can you <unk>
What you look at is <unk> attitudes that people may inspire when you get certain questions.
<unk> in the <unk> <unk> in the <unk>
Now, if somebody told you <unk> in the <unk>
<unk> in the <unk>
<unk> in the teachers of <unk>
Probably <unk> for asking, "What do what?"
And that would be a very <unk> response.
And you could say, when you've answered your question, "Well, I trust some not."
Which is very rational.
Ultimately, in real life, we tend to place trust <unk>
We don't assume that the level of trust that we're going to feel by a certain type of a <unk> official or the type of person, is going to be uniform in all cases.
I could, for example, saying that I trust a certain teacher of elementary school that I know to give the kind of reading, but in any way to drive the school <unk>
After all, I could know that it wasn't a good <unk>
I could trust my closest friend to keep a conversation, but no, maybe to hold a secret.
Simple.
And if we've gotten those evidence in our everyday lives in the way that trust is <unk> why we leave the whole knowledge of knowledge when we think of trust in the form of <unk>
I think that surveys are very bad tools to measure the real level of real confidence, because they try to <unk> the good inherent judgment of trusting something or someone.
Second, what about the goal?
The goal is to have more confidence.
Frankly, I think it's an stupid.
It's not that the objective I <unk>
I <unk> to have more confidence in what is <unk> but not what it is.
Ultimately, I'm <unk> not <unk> in which it is not reliable.
And I think that those people who had their savings with the very <unk> called Mr. <unk> who then disappeared with them, I think of them, I think, yes, they were too <unk>
Having more confidence is not an intelligent goal in this life.
<unk> <unk> or <unk> <unk> that's the right goal.
Once you say, it says, yes, this means that what matters first is not trust, but trustworthiness.
What it's about is to do a judgment on how reliable people are in certain ways.
And I think to be able to do a trial, we're forced to focus on three things.
They're <unk> They're <unk> They're <unk>
And if we found that one person is <unk> in the <unk> and it's responsible and honest, then we'll have a very good reason to trust it, because it's going to be worthy of confidence.
But if, in the contrary, they're not responsible we couldn't trust them.
I have friends who are <unk> and honest but not <unk> in them to bring a letter to the <unk> because they're <unk>
I have friends who are very sure that they can do certain things, but that I see that we have their own <unk>
And I'm very glad to say that I think I don't have many friends who are <unk> and responsible but extremely <unk>
If it's like this, I still haven't <unk>
But that's what we're <unk> to <unk>
<unk> is the answer.
The <unk> is what we need to <unk>
And of course, it's hard.
Over the last decades, we've been trying to build <unk> systems for all kinds of institutions, <unk> officials and so on, that made us easier to judge their trustworthiness.
Many of those systems have had the opposite effect.
They don't work as <unk>
And I remember once I was talking to a <unk> and he said, "Well, you'll see the problem is that it takes more time to make <unk> <unk> which will be <unk>
And we found the same problem in all of our public life, and I think that the accountability system that is destined to ensure the <unk> and the testing of <unk> is actually doing the opposite.
What they're doing is <unk> the work of people who have to do hard tasks, like <unk> <unk> that <unk> the <unk> as we say.
Now you may have all known examples.
It <unk> all of that, by the goal.
I think the goal should be more <unk> and that things would be different if we think about being worthy of trust and <unk> to the people who are reliable and whether to determine whether other people or officials are worthy of trust.
It's not easy. It's the trial, the simple action, the <unk> which doesn't do properly.
Third, the task.
<unk> the task to rebuild the confidence, it puts things upside down.
It suggests that you and I should rebuild the trust.
Well, we can do it with ourselves.
We can reconstruct a little bit of trustworthiness.
We can do it if they're two people together, trying to improve trust.
But the trust, ultimately, it's <unk> because you give it other people.
You can't reconstruct what other people have given you.
You have to give them the foundations of enough so that you can trust you.
You have to be worthy of confidence.
And that, of course, is because of course, you cannot <unk> usually, all of the people, all the time.
But you also have to do evidence that you're worthy of confidence.
How do we do that?
That makes it every day, everywhere, it makes the common people, <unk> institutions, very effectively.
I'll give you a simple commercial example.
The store where I buy my socks says I can <unk> without giving explanations for us.
I take them back and get it back and get it back and get it back from the color that I want.
That's great. I trust them because they become vulnerable to me.
I think there's a big lesson on that.
If you become vulnerable to the other hand, that's a very good proof that you're worthy of trust and you have confidence in what you're saying.
So in the end, I think that what we're pointing is not a very difficult thing to <unk>
What people rely on is relationships, and in that framework, they can determine when and how the other person is <unk>
Thank you.
From the beginning of computers we have been <unk> by reducing the separation between us and the digital information, the separation between our material world and the world of the screen where imagination can be <unk>
This separation has been increasingly <unk> and more and more, at such point that today, it's less than one millimeter, the thickness of a tactile screen, and the power of computing has become accessible to everyone.
But I ask myself, and if I had no <unk>
I started imagining how to <unk>
First of all, I created this tool that goes into digital space, so that when the strong <unk> against the screen, its physical body to pixels.
Designers can <unk> their ideas directly in 3D, and surgeons can practice virtual organs underneath the screen.
So with this tool.
But the two hands remain still out of the screen.
How do you get inside and interact with digital information using all the dexterity of your hands?
In the separation of Sciences <unk> <unk> along with my mentor <unk> <unk> the computer and transformed a small space on the keyboard in a labor of work.
<unk> a transparent bombsight with remote cameras to detect the fingers and the face, now you can lift the hands of the keyboard, get inside of the 3D space, and grab pixels directly with your hands.
Like the windows and archives have a location in real space, it's so easy to grab a book from a <unk>
You can flip through the book and you want to highlight lines, or the words with the virtual <unk> sensor that is down on every floating screen.
Architects can stretch or rotate their models directly with their hands.
In these examples, we <unk> in the digital world.
And if we invest the papers and make digital information come towards us?
<unk> many of us will have bought and returned from the Internet.
Now that doesn't have to worry about.
What I have here is an online <unk> on the Internet.
This is the vision that you get from a device on your head or <unk> when the system understands the geometry of your body.
If we take this idea further, I thought, instead of just seeing pixels in space, how can we make them physicists so that we can <unk> and <unk>
How would a future like this?
At the MIT Media Lab, with my <unk> Hiroshi Ishii, and my <unk> Post, we created this only physical video.
This <unk> magnet is behaving as a 3D pixel in space, which means that the computer as users can move the object anywhere within this small three-dimensional space.
<unk> what we did was we <unk> gravity and control the movement through a combination of <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk>
And when we program digitally programming the object, we release it from the constraints of time and space, which means that human movements can <unk> and go to reproduce and stay in the physical world.
You can teach it physically and physically <unk> and the famous shot of Michael Jordan, can reproduce as a physics physics that we want to.
Students can use it as a tool to understand complicated concepts like the movement of planets, physics, and unlike the <unk> or textbooks, this is a real and <unk> experience that you can touch and feel. It's very powerful.
But what's more fascinating than changing the physics part of the computer is to imagine how to program the world is going to change our everyday physical activities.
As you can see, digital information will not just show you something but to begin to act directly on us as part of the physical world around us without us to have to <unk> our world.
We started talking about a barrier, but if you <unk> that barrier, the only limit that is left is our imagination.
Thank you.
I was <unk> to become <unk> for two years in <unk> China, in the <unk> years.
When I was in the first grade, the government wanted to <unk> a school for athletes with all expenses <unk>
But my tiger mother said, "No."
My parents wanted me to become engineering and like them.
After surviving the Islamic Revolution -- they create firmly that there was only a <unk> path to <unk> a safe job and well <unk>
No matter if the work would like or not.
But my dream was to be an opera singer <unk>
This was me, in my imaginary piano.
An opera singer must start <unk> from very young to learn the <unk> so I tried everything I could to go to the opera school.
I even wrote the director of the school and a radio show program.
But no adult would give you the idea.
No adult took me seriously.
Just my friends, but they were children, without authority, like me.
So at age 15 years, I knew it was too much greater to train.
My dream never <unk>
<unk> that for the rest of my life a second class is the only thing I could aspire to.
And this was so unfair.
So I decided to look for another <unk>
No one to me wanted to <unk> OK.
They went to books.
<unk> <unk> of <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> I came to the United States in 1995, and what were the first books that we were here?
Those who were <unk> in China, of course.
"The Good <unk> is about Chinese life.
And it's not propaganda <unk> <unk>
The Bible is interesting, but weird.
That's a subject for another day.
But the fifth commandment for me was a <unk> <unk> to your father and your mother."
<unk> I said to myself, "It's so different, and much better than you are."
So it became my tool to get out of this <unk> <unk> and to <unk> the relationship with my parents.
I find it with a new culture also gave rise to my reading <unk>
<unk> a lot of perspectives.
So for example, this map seemed to me out of place because this is what students in China are.
I never had happened to me that China didn't have to be in the center of the world.
A map involves the perspective of people.
The comparative reading is not something new.
It's a common practice in the academic world.
There are even the fields of research as comparative religion and literature <unk>
<unk> and <unk> offers academics a deeper understanding of a subject.
And I thought if I read comparative reading worked for research, why not do it in life <unk>
So I started reading books from two.
They may be <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> who were involved in a <unk> or friends with <unk> experiences.
By <unk> <unk> are economic and <unk>
For Buddha, they are all <unk> lust, fear and duty of <unk> Interesting.
If you know another language, it's also fun to read your favorite books in two languages.
<unk> path of <unk> Thomas <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> Instead of missing in the translation, found that you can win a lot of it.
For example, it's through the translation that I realized that <unk> Chinese literally means <unk> <unk> <unk>
And <unk> in Chinese, literally means <unk> <unk> <unk>
The books opened up a magic door to connect with people from the past and the present.
I know I won't feel like I used to feel like or <unk>
Having a <unk> dream is really not compared to what many others have <unk>
I've come to believe that <unk> is not the only purpose of a dream.
Their most important purpose is to connect to the place that the dreams come from, where the passion comes from, where happiness comes from.
Even a broken dream can do that for you.
And it's because of the books, that I'm happy here, happy, living again with purpose and clearly, most of the time.
So the books always <unk>
Thank you.
Thank you.  Thank you.
When I was in my <unk> I saw my first client to <unk>
I was a Ph.D. student in clinical psychology, in Berkeley.
She was a <unk> woman named <unk>
Alex walked into the first session using jeans and a <unk> <unk> stood on the couch in my office -- he took off the shoes and told me that I wanted to talk about his problems with men.
When I heard this, I felt so <unk>
My <unk> roommate had a <unk> like a <unk>
And I got a <unk> I wanted to talk about men.
I thought I could handle it.
But I didn't.
With the <unk> stories that Alex brought to the <unk> made me easy only to move my head while it <unk> the solution.
<unk> are the <unk> new <unk> saying Alex, and so I looked at it, she was right.
You start to work after, you get home after, you have children after the death happens.
For <unk> as Alex and I had plenty of time.
But shortly afterwards, my <unk> <unk> me to press Alex who would talk about his life <unk>
I was <unk>
I said, "Yes, he's going out with guys under your category, <unk> with a <unk> head, but it's not as if it were to marry him."
And then my <unk> said, "No, no, but maybe it <unk> with the next.
Also, the best time to work on marriage is before it <unk>
This is what psychologists call a <unk> moment.
It was when I realized that <unk> are not the new <unk>
Yes, people feel head after what they did, but this didn't make the <unk> of Alex being a break.
This made the <unk> of Alex the perfect moment and we were <unk>
And then I realized, that this kind of benign <unk> was a real problem and had real consequences not only for Alex and his loving life, but for the careers, the families and the future of <unk> everywhere.
There are 50 million <unk> in the United States, today.
That means 15 percent of the population, or 100 percent if they think no one gets to adulthood without going to happen before the <unk>
Raise your hand if you're in your <unk>
I want to see the <unk> here.
Oh, yeah! They're amazing.
If you work with <unk> they love a <unk> you get rid of a <unk> I want to see. All right. They really matter.
This is not just my opinion. These are the facts.
We know that 80 percent of the key moments in life will go to the 35 years.
That means eight in 10 decisions and experiences and moments and moments that give your life to be past when you have 30 and <unk>
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
This audience is going to be fine, I believe.
We know that the first 10 years of a career have been an exponential impact on how much money they <unk>
We know that more than half of the Americans are married, they live or come out with their future partner at 30 years.
We know that the brain ends up its second and last stage of growth in their <unk> and <unk> for <unk> which means that if there is something you want to change yourself, now is the moment to change it.
We know that the personality changes more times during their <unk> than at any other moment of life, and we know that the female fertility gets to the top 28, and things become complicated to <unk>
The <unk> are the moment to <unk> on their body and their options.
When we think about as a child, we all know that the first five years are crucial to language and attachment to the brain.
It's a moment in which your everyday and common life has an impact on the person that was <unk>
But what we don't hear often is that there is something called adult development and our <unk> are a critical moment in the adult development.
But this is not what the <unk> are listening.
The newspapers talk about changes in the line of <unk>
Researchers call <unk> an extended adolescence.
journalists named <unk> names by <unk> <unk> and <unk>
It's true.
As a culture, we've considered a <unk> which is actually the decade that defines the <unk>
Leonard Cohen, was saying that to achieve big things, you need a plan and not enough time.
Isn't that true?
What do you think happens when you drop a <unk> in your head and you say, "You have another 10 years to start your <unk>
Nothing happens.
They stole that person the sense of urgency and his ambition and it doesn't happen absolutely nothing.
And then every day, smart intelligent, interesting as you or your children and daughters come to my office and say something like this: "I know that my boyfriend is not good for me, but this relationship is not <unk> I'm just killing time."
Or they say, "Everybody says that while I start a race before 30, everything is right."
But then it starts to sound something like this: "My <unk> are going to be <unk> and I still have nothing to show you.
I had better copy the day I graduated from <unk>
And then he starts to sound something like this: "My quotes during the <unk> were like the game of chairs.
They were running and <unk> but then at some point around the 30, the music went off."
I didn't want to be the only one who ran stop, so sometimes I think I married my husband because he was the nearest chair when he had <unk>
Where are the <unk> here?
Don't do that.
Well, that sounds a bit end, but it's not <unk> the risks are very high.
When you leave a lot of things for <unk> there is a huge pressure to 30 and so many of us start a career, choose a city, to pick a couple, and have two or three children in a period of time.
Many of these things are not <unk> and there's research that starts to show that it's much more difficult and stressful <unk> to do everything from once to <unk>
The middle age crisis is not about buying red.
It's about realizing that you can't have the career you want now.
<unk> you can't have the son you want to do now, or you can't give your child a child.
Many <unk> and <unk> you see themselves, and I sat in the room, and they talk about their <unk> "What was you thinking?"
I want to change what <unk> are doing and thinking.
Here's a story of how it might be.
It's a story about a woman named <unk>
On the 25, Emma came to my office because I was, in his own words, having an identity.
He said I'd like to work in art or in entertainment, but I still couldn't decide, so I spent the last few years working as a <unk>
As it was cheaper, I lived with a boyfriend, who showed more <unk> than ambition.
And even though I live a few <unk> very difficult, their previous life, had been even more difficult.
<unk> often in our <unk> but then they woke up and she to say, "You don't choose your family, but you can choose your friends."
Well, one day Emma got his head on his legs and cried for almost the hour.
I just had to buy a new book to <unk> and I had spent the whole morning to <unk> with his many <unk> but then he was seeing the empty space that follows after the words <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
I was about to <unk> when he saw me and he said, "Who is going to be for me if I have a <unk> accident.
Who is going to take care of me if I was <unk>
At that time, I had a lot of work for me to resist and don't say, <unk>
What Emma needed was not a <unk> that really <unk>
She needed a better life, and I knew this was his opportunity.
I had learned a lot since I worked with Alex as to just sit in the next decade of Emma going forward.
So, for the next few weeks and months, I said to Emma three things that all <unk> man or woman, deserves to know.
First of all, I said to Emma that <unk> out of that identity crisis and social capital <unk>
For identity, I mean to do something that add value to your person.
Doing something that is an investment in what they want to be after.
I didn't know the future of <unk> and no one knows the future of work, but I do know this: <unk> capital generates of identity.
So now it's the moment for that work on the other side of the country, from that <unk> of that company that they want to try.
I'm not <unk> <unk> exploration, I'm <unk> the exploration that I shouldn't tell -- that by the way, it's not exploration,
It's <unk>
I said to Emma that exploits jobs and to do it.
Second, I said to Emma that the urban tribes are <unk>
The best friends are great to take you at the airport, but the <unk> who come together with friends with the similar minds are limited to who you know, what you know, how they think about how they talk, and where they work.
That new piece of capital, that new person who comes out is almost always come from the outside of their <unk>
The new things come from what you call weak <unk> friends of friends from their friends.
Yes, half of the <unk> have a bad job or they don't have work.
But the other half not, and the weak links are the way to <unk> this group.
Half of the work work never <unk> then to meet the head of your neighbor is how they get a work not published.
It's not cheating. It's the science of how information is going on.
Last but not least, Emma believed you don't choose your family, but I know your friends.
This was true when I was growing up, but like <unk> Emma soon <unk> to his family when he has a partner and there is their own family.
I said to Emma that the time to choose his family had come.
Maybe you think that 30 is better to sit around than 20 or even 25, and I agree with you.
But choose the person you live now or <unk> now when everyone on Facebook begin to walk into the <unk> not progress.
The best time to work in marriage is before you have, and that implies to be so <unk> in love as you're at work.
<unk> your family has to be a conscious choice of who and what they want instead of just making it work or killing time with anyone who will encourage you.
So what happened to <unk>
Well, we went through that <unk> and she found a roommate a quarter of a cousin who worked in an art museum in another state.
This weak bond helped him get a job there.
That offer of work gave him a reason to leave the boyfriend, I alive.
Now, five years later, it's <unk> special events of events in museums.
This married with a man who chose <unk>
<unk> his new career, I love his new family, and send me a letter to say, "Now the spaces of emergency contacts are not <unk> enough.
The story of Emma may sound easy, but that's what I love to work with <unk>
It's very easy to help you.
<unk> are like planes coming out from the airport from Los Angeles, which come to some place in the West <unk>
Just before the <unk> a light fit on its trajectory makes the difference between land in Alaska or <unk>
In the same way, at the age of 21, or 25 and even <unk> a good conversation, a good TED Talk can have huge effects over the next few years or even in the next generations.
Here's my idea that I was worth spreading to all of the <unk> you know.
It's as simple as what I learned to say to <unk>
It's what I now have the privilege of saying to <unk> like Emma every day: <unk> are not the new <unk> <unk> their <unk> get your <unk> get their weak <unk> you choose to your family.
Don't let you define what they didn't know or what they didn't do.
They're deciding their life today.
Thank you.
When I was 27 years old, I left a very tough management work, for a job that was even more <unk> the <unk>
I went to teach them mathematics with seventh grade schools in New York schools.
And as any teacher, I took tests and tests.
Do you give them assignments.
When I work back, <unk> grades.
What struck me was that I.Q. was not the only difference between my best and my worst students.
Some of the people who had a better performance didn't have scores of <unk> I.Q.
Some of my smartest kids weren't doing so well.
And that got me thinking.
The kind of thing you need to learn in seventh grade, sure, are <unk> <unk> <unk> the area of a <unk>
But these concepts are not impossible and I was very convinced that every one of my students could learn the lesson if they were working hard and during enough.
After several years more than <unk> I came to the conclusion that what we need in education is a better understanding of students and learning from a <unk> perspective, from a psychological perspective.
In education, the only thing we know how to measure <unk>
It's <unk> but what happens if you succeed in school and in life it depends on much more than the ability to learn in a fast and easy?
So I left the classrooms and I went to college to become <unk>
I started studying kids and adults in all sorts of <unk> scenarios and in every study of my question was, who has success here and why?
My research team and I went to the Academy <unk> West <unk>
We try to predict what <unk> <unk> in military training and who are <unk>
We went to the National <unk> National <unk> and we tried to predict what children were going to do as far as possible in competition.
We studied teachers <unk> working in neighborhoods really hard, <unk> who teachers are still teaching for the end of the year of school and <unk> who will be the most effective in improving the learning results.
We associate with private enterprises, asking yourself, what about these marketers are going to keep their job <unk>
Who is going to make more money?
In all those very different contexts, came a feature as an important <unk> of success.
And it wasn't social intelligence.
It wasn't the good look, the physical health and no I.Q.
It was <unk>
<unk> is passion and <unk> to achieve very long term.
<unk> is to have resistance.
The determination is clinging to its future, day after day, not only for the month, but for years and working hard to make that future a reality.
The determination is to live life as if it was a <unk> not a <unk>
A few years ago, I started studying determination in Chicago public schools.
I asked thousands of high school students that did my <unk> and then waited for over a year to see who <unk>
It turns out that the children with more agency had significantly significantly better than <unk> even when they <unk> them on every feature that I could measure, things like family income, the results of the <unk> <unk> even the security that children felt when they were in school.
So it's not only in West Point or in the National <unk> <unk> where <unk> <unk> is also in school, especially for kids at risk of <unk>
For me, the most powerful thing about determination is how little we know how little it knows the science about development.
Every day, parents and teachers ask me, "How do we develop the determination for children?
What should I do to teach kids a hard job for work?
How do I keep them motivated for the long <unk>
The most honest answer is, I don't know.  What I know is that talent doesn't <unk>
Our data shows very clearly that there are many talented individuals who just don't follow on their <unk>
In fact, in our data, the determination commonly is not related or it's related to connecting moral <unk>
So far, the best idea I've heard about developing the determination of children is something called <unk>
This is an idea that was developed at Stanford University and is the belief that the ability to learn is not <unk> that it can change the effort.
Dr. <unk> has shown that when kids read and learn about the brain and how it changes and grow in response to the challenge, they're much more likely to <unk> when they <unk> because they don't believe that that failure is a permanent condition.
So the growth mindset is a great idea to develop <unk>
But we need more.
And that's where I end up my speech, because that's where we are.
That's the work that we have to do.
We need to take our best ideas, our strongest intuitions and we need to <unk>
We need to measure whether they have been successful and we have to be willing to fail, to <unk> to start all again with the <unk> lessons to begin again.
In other words, we need to be determined about making our children more <unk>
Thank you.
<unk> in Taiwan as the daughter of a <unk> one of my most <unk> memories is my mother, the shape and the shape of the Chinese characters Chinese.
From that time, I was struck by this incredible language.
But for a foreign one, it seems to be as <unk> as the Great Wall China.
In the last few years, I've been asking myself if I can break down this <unk> so that you want to understand and appreciate the beauty of this sophisticated language can do it.
I started thinking about how a new method and quickly learning that Chinese will be useful.
Since I was five years old, I started learning how to draw each of the strokes of every character on the right sequence.
I learned new characters every day for the next 15 years.
Because we only have five minutes, it's better than we do it in a faster and simple.
A Chinese academic <unk> <unk> 20,000 characters.
You just need a thousand to understand basic <unk>
The first 200 will allow you to understand 40 percent of the basic literature, enough enough to read traffic traffic signals, we understand the basic idea of the pages or the newspapers.
Today I'll start with eight to show you how the method works.
Are you ready?
You open your mouth as much as you could until it's <unk>
They get a mouth.
This is a person who will go for a walk.
<unk>
If the form of fire is a person with arms on both sides, as if I were yelling at <unk> <unk> I'm <unk> This symbol is actually <unk> of the form of <unk> but I like to believe it is the other way.
This is a tree.
tree.
This is a mountain.
The sun.
The moon.
The symbol of the door looks like a couple doors of a <unk> in the <unk>
I call these eight characters.
They are building blocks so that they create many more characters.
A person.
If somebody walks back, that's <unk>
As the old saying, two are company, three are <unk>
If one person stretch their arms, this person is saying <unk> so big.
The person inside the mouth, the person is <unk>
It's a <unk> like <unk> inside the whale.
A tree is a tree. Two trees together, we have a forest.
Three trees together, we also have the forest.
Put a chart under the tree, we have the <unk>
Put a mouth on the tree, that's a <unk>  <unk> of birth, because a tree speaker, it's quite an idiot.
Remember the <unk>
Two fireworks together, it becomes very hot.
Three <unk> together, that's a lot of flames.
Put the fire under the two trees, that's <unk>
For us, the sun is the source of prosperity.
Two suns together, <unk>
Three together, those are <unk>
Put the sun and the moon together, that's the <unk>
It also means tomorrow, after one day and one night.
The sun comes out on the <unk> horizon.
A door, put a chart inside the door, it's the <unk> of the door.
Put a mouth inside the door, ask questions.
<unk> <unk> <unk>
This person is coming out of a door, <unk> <unk>
On the left, we have a woman.
Two women together, they're <unk>
Three women together, they're <unk>
So we've gone through almost 30 characters.
By using this method, the first eight radical <unk> will allow you to build 32.
The next group of eight characters will build another 32.
So with each small effort, you'll be able to learn a couple hundred characters, which is the same thing that you learn a Chinese <unk>
So after knowing the characters, we started creating sentences.
For example, the mountain and fire together, we have a mountain of fire. It's a <unk>
We know that Japan is the soil of the sun <unk>
This is a sun in the beginning, because Japan is east of China.
So a sun next to the beginning, we create Japan.
A person behind Japan, what do we have?
A Japanese person.
The character on the left are two mountains stacked one over the other.
In ancient China, that meant in exile, because Chinese <unk> to their enemy enemies beyond the mountains.
Today, the <unk> has become out.
A mouth that tells you where to go out is a <unk>
This is a slide to remind me that I should stop talking and step down the stage. Thank you.
What I prefer to be Dad is the films that I get to see.
I love to share my favorite films with my <unk> when my daughter was four years old, we saw the <unk> magician together.
The movie was taken for months for months.
His favorite character was <unk> of course.
He gave a good excuse to use a brilliant dress and get a magic wand on it.
But when you see that movie so many times, you get to understand that it's remarkable.
We now live and raise our children in a kind of industrial complex <unk>
However, the magician magician was an event itself.
It didn't start that trend.
The trend really took for 40 years later with, interestingly enough, another movie whose <unk> a metal boy and a boy <unk> <unk> a girl dressed as an enemy of the enemy.
You know what I'm talking about?  Yes.
There's a big difference between these two movies, there's a couple of big differences between the magician of Oz and all the films that we see today.
One is there is very little violence in the <unk>
The monkeys are pretty aggressive, like the <unk>
But I think that if the magician magician would be done today, the magician would say, <unk> you're the salvation of Oz as a prophecy.
<unk> magic shoes to defeat the <unk> of the evil <unk>
But that's not what happens.
Another one of the <unk> magician is that the most <unk> characters and even <unk> are women.
I began to notice this when I did Star Wars <unk> my daughter, a few years later, and the situation was different.
At that time, I also had a child.
Only three years.
It wasn't invited to projection because it was still very small for that.
But it was the second son, and the level of <unk> had <unk>  So he stood in the room and was impressed as a mom with his <unk> behind, and I don't think he understood what was happening, but <unk> <unk> everything.
I wonder what <unk>
They would be <unk> <unk> resilience and <unk>
I would have a sense that Luke was an army to <unk> the government?
<unk> this with the <unk> magician <unk>
How do you win his movie?
We're doing good <unk> with all and being a <unk>
It's the kind of world that I want my kids to grow up to them, OK? And not a world of men who <unk> that is where we are.
Why is there so much <unk> <unk> force in the movies for our kids, and so little from the road <unk>
There's a lot of literature about the impact of male violence in the girls, and they should be <unk> It's very good.
I haven't read so much about how kids react to this encouragement.
I know the experience that Princess <unk> does not provide the right framework that would have served me to navigate the world of adults who is <unk>  I think at the moment of the first <unk> I really expected the credits of the film, because it's the end of the film, right?
My search for this is done, I have <unk>
Why are you standing there?
I don't know what I should do.
The films are focused on defeat <unk> and getting your reward, and they don't leave time for other relationships or other <unk>
It's almost like a child, you have to be a silly animal, and if you're a girl, you have to wear a <unk>
There are lots of exceptions, and to defend the <unk> of Disney to any of you.
But they send a message to the kids, even though they, guys, they're not really their goal.
They do phenomenal work by teaching girls how to defend the <unk> but they don't necessarily show kids how to protect the <unk>
There's no model for them.
We also have some great women who write new stories for our children, and so real, lovely as <unk> and <unk> but they don't stop being a war movies.
Of course, the most successful topic of all time continues to come up in classic after classic, each of them on the adventures of a child or a man, or two men who are friends, or a man and their son, or two men who are raising a child.
Until a lot of you are thinking, this year, finally came out.
I recommend all of you. It's already available in shops.
Do you remember what the critique was when he came <unk>
I can't believe that Pixar has made a movie of a <unk>
It's very good. Don't let that <unk>
Well, almost none of these movies happens to <unk>
I don't know if you've heard about this.
It's still not <unk> and it's already <unk> but maybe we're going to start a movement.
<unk> <unk> is a comic book <unk> and in the <unk> I recorded a conversation that had had a friend about the evaluation of the movies that you saw.
And it's very simple. There are only three questions that must be <unk> In the movie, there's more of a female character that has lines?
So, you have to fulfill the <unk>
These women talk to each other at some point in the movie?
Their conversations are about something other than the guy that you like it,    Thank you.  Thank you very much.
Two women who exist and talk about things each other.
<unk> I've seen, and yet I rarely see it in the movie that we know and love.
In fact, this week, I went to see a very good quality, <unk>
Right? <unk> of <unk> success by <unk> an idea of a consensus of what is a Hollywood <unk>
<unk> doesn't go through the <unk> test.
And I don't think it <unk> because a lot of the movie, I don't know if you've seen it, a lot of the movie happens in an embassy where men and women are hidden during the <unk> crisis.
We have a lot of scenes of men who have deep and painful conversations in this <unk> and it's the great time for one of the actors to take a look at the door, and say, "Let's go to bed, <unk>
This is Hollywood.
So let's go back in the numbers.
In 2011, in the 100 most popular movies, how many of them believe they have <unk>
<unk> Not bad.
It's not the same percentage of the number of women we've chosen recently for Congress, so it's okay.
But there's one larger number that this is going to <unk> this room.
Last year, The New York Times published a study that was done.
This is what he said, <unk>
In the United States, one in five women said it's been sexually assaulted once in their life.
I don't think it's the guilt of mass entertainment.
I don't think the films for kids have something to do with that.
I don't think music of music or pornography are closely <unk> but something wrong, and when I hear that <unk> one of the things that I think is there is a huge amount of sexual <unk>
Who are those <unk> What are they <unk>
What do you do <unk>
They're <unk> the story that says that the role of a male hero is to defeat the <unk> with violence and then charge the reward, which is a woman who has no friends and not <unk>
We are <unk> that story?
You know, as a father with the privilege of raising a daughter like those of you who are doing the same thing, we find this world and this very startling statistic and we want to <unk>
We have tools to our available to our arrangement as <unk> <unk> and we hope that that will happen, but I have to ask, <unk> is going to be <unk> if, at the same time, active or <unk> we are educating our kids to keep their power <unk>
I mean, I think the list of Netflix is a way to do something really important, and here I mean mainly the parents.
I think we have to show our children a new definition of <unk>
The definition of masculinity is radically changing everything.
You've read about how the new economy is changing the role that you care about home and <unk>
It's all changing.
When I asked my daughter what was his favorite Star Trek character -- you know what you <unk>
<unk>
<unk> <unk> and <unk>
What are these two?
Maybe it's not just the brilliant dress.
I think they are experts.
I think these are the two people in those films that you know more than anyone, and they love to share their knowledge with other people to try to reach their potential.
They're leaders.
I like that kind of stories for my daughter, and I like that kind of stories for my son.
I want more stories like that.
I want less stories in which I tell my <unk> <unk> and struggle only and more stories where he looked at their work is join a team, maybe a team led by women, helping other people better and better people, like the <unk> <unk>
Thank you.
As a child, I was living in Maine, and one of the things that I liked most was looking for <unk> from the shores of Maine because my parents told me that that would give me luck.
But you know, it's hard to find these <unk>
They're covered in sand and it's hard to see them.
However, over time, I was invited to <unk>
I started to see shapes and patterns that helped me <unk>
This became a passion for finding things, in a love for past and <unk>
And finally when I started studying <unk> I realized that I saw with my own eyes wasn't enough.
Because suddenly in Egypt, in Egypt, my little beach in Maine had grown up about about 1.3 miles of length next to the <unk>
And my sea cookies had grown up the size of cities.
This is really what led me to use satellite images.
To try to do a map of the past, I knew I had to see in a different way.
I want to show you an example of how different the infrared <unk>
This is a place located in the eastern Delta, of Egypt called <unk>
And the place, it seems to be brown, but when we use infrared and process it using fake color, suddenly the place looks like pink <unk>
What you're seeing is the real chemical changes of the landscape caused by building materials and the old Egyptians activities.
I want to share with you how we use satellite data to find an old city, to find an old city, called <unk> missing for thousands of years.
<unk> was the ancient capital of Egypt for over 400 years in a period of time called the Middle <unk> about 4,000 years ago.
The place is located in <unk> Egypt, and it's really important because in the Middle Empire there was this great renaissance of ancient art, architecture and religion.
<unk> have always known that <unk> was located somewhere near the pyramids of the two kings that are <unk> <unk> inside the red circles here, but somewhere within this huge <unk> <unk>
This area is massive, it's about <unk> by <unk> kilometers.
Before, the Nile <unk> right next to <unk> and as it changed over time, we moved to this and covered the entire city.
So how do you find a city in a <unk> <unk>
And you'll find out the random equivalent would be the equivalent of a needle in a <unk> with the eyes <unk> and using baseball <unk>
So, we use NASA <unk> data to make a map of place, with very subtle changes.
We were able to see where the <unk> <unk>
But you can see more <unk> and it's even more interesting, this slightly large area that you see inside the circle here, which we think might be the location of <unk>
So we collaborated with scientific scientists doing <unk> jobs can see here.
When I say <unk> it's like the shots that are shown in ice, but instead of layers of climate change, we look for layers of human <unk>
Five meters down, below a thick layer of mud, we found a dense layer of <unk>
That means that in this possible location of <unk> five meters down, we have a layer of occupation for several hundred years that date from the Roman Empire exactly the same period that we think is <unk>
We also found <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> which shows that there was a <unk> workshop.
This might seem like it's not a lot, but when we think about the most common stones that used in the jewelry of the Roman Empire these are the stones that are <unk>
So, we have a dense layer of occupation that comes from the Middle <unk> in this place.
We also have evidence of a elite jewelry shop that demonstrates that what has been there, was a very important city.
We don't yet find it <unk> here, but <unk> the place in a near future for <unk>
And most importantly, we have the resources to train young Egyptians in the use of satellite technology so that they can also make great discoveries.
I want to end with my favorite quote from the Roman Empire which was probably written in <unk> four years ago.
<unk> knowledge is most of the <unk>
There's nothing like that on the ground.
So I think, TED wasn't founded in 1984 <unk> C.
Do that ideas actually started in in 1984 B.C.
It certainly puts the search for <unk> in perspective.
Thank you very much.
Thank you.
I want to invite you to close your eyes.
Imagine standing outside, in front of the door of <unk>
I'd like you to pay attention to the color of the door, to the material that's made.
Now we <unk> a group of obese drug <unk>
They're competing in a bicycle <unk> and they're going to go back to their entry door.
I need to look at this <unk>
They're <unk> <unk> they're <unk>
And they collide against the door of your house.
There is bicycles flying around and wheels that go on their side, rays from the wheels that end up in places -- <unk> the threshold of the door.
<unk> to the hall, or what there is to the other side of the door, and notice the quality of the light, the light is shining on the <unk> of <unk>
<unk> with the hand.
From his chair on a brown horse.
It's a horse that we talk about.
You can feel your blue <unk> you can tickle your nose.
You can smell the <unk> <unk> and you see it's about to get into the mouth.
<unk> on one side and enter his living room.
Because in the room, and making peak of their imagination, imagine it to Britney <unk>
It's with little clothes, dancing over its <unk> singing <unk> singing <unk> One more <unk>
Now I go to cooking.
The ground has been coated with a <unk> path of yellow <unk> and from the oven come to you -- the Man of <unk> the <unk> and the <unk> of "The Wizard of <unk> <unk> of the hands, <unk>
Okay. Open your eyes.
I want to tell you about a peculiar contest that takes every spring in New York.
It's called the <unk> <unk>
I went to cover this event a few years ago as a journalist, <unk> waiting, I guess, that this was like the end of a <unk> <unk>
There were several men and a few different men -- ladies and different habits of sanitation.
They were <unk> hundreds of numbers, look at them just once.
They <unk> the names of tens and dozens of strangers.
We would add whole poems in just minutes.
<unk> to see who could memorize the order of a deck of <unk>
And I thought, "This is <unk>
These people must be <unk>
And I started talking to some of the competitors.
This one, this is a man named Ed <unk> who had come from England and he has one of the best <unk>
And I said, <unk> when you realized you were a <unk>
Ed replied, "I'm not a wise.
Actually, I have a average memory.
Everybody who participate in this competition say they have normal memory.
We have trained to perform these miraculous acts of memory using some old techniques invented in Greece, the same techniques that we used to <unk> to memorize the <unk> and that the <unk> academics used to memorize <unk> books.
And my reaction was: How did I have no ear of this <unk>
We were standing outside the room of competition, and <unk> who is a wonderful and brilliant English <unk> and he said, <unk> you are an American journalist.
You know Britney <unk>
And I said, "What? No, why?
"Because I'd like to teach Britney <unk> how to memorize the order in a deck of cards live on national TV.
That will prove to the world that anybody can do it."
And I said, "Well, I'm not Britney <unk> but maybe you can teach me to me.
I mean, you have to start for something <unk>
And that was the beginning of a very strange journey to me.
And I ended up spending most of the year next year, not only training my memory, but also <unk> trying to understand how it works, why sometimes it doesn't work, and what their potential.
I met a lot of really interesting people.
This is a man named <unk>
He's <unk> very likely with the worst memory in the world.
His memory was so bad that I didn't even remember it had a problem of <unk> it's amazing.
Someone incredibly tragic, but it was a window that allows us to see how our memory is we are.
On the other end of the spectrum I met this man.
This is Kim <unk> He was based on the role of <unk> <unk> in the movie <unk> <unk>
We spent one afternoon together in the public library in Salt Lake City, <unk> <unk> <unk> was <unk>
And on the back, the amount of treaties on the memory written about over 2,000 years ago in Latin, in <unk> and then in the Dark Ages.
And I learned a lot of really interesting things.
One of the most interesting things I learned is that there was a time when this idea of having <unk> disciplined and <unk> wasn't such as rare as it can seem like today.
A long time ago, people invest in their memory, to provide <unk> their minds.
These techniques have made our modern world, but they also changed us.
We have changed <unk> and I would say that they have changed our <unk>
As we have almost no need to remember, sometimes we have forgotten how to do it.
One of the last places on our planet where you still find people passionate about this idea of a disciplined and disciplined and <unk> is this very unique competition of memory.
It's actually not that <unk> there's <unk> like this all over the world.
I was <unk> I wanted to know how these people do.
A few years ago, a team of researchers from University College in London, invited a group of memory champions into the lab.
They wanted to know: Is it got brains in some form or structural or <unk> different from the rest of us?
The answer was, no.
They're actually smarter than the <unk>
They gave them a <unk> battery battery and the answer was actually not.
There was yet a really interesting difference and significant and significant difference between the brains of memory champions and the subjects of control with them.
When they put them on an MRI machine, <unk> their brains while <unk> numbers, faces and <unk> forms of <unk> They found that in memory champions are <unk> parts of the brain, different from others.
They <unk> or seemed <unk> a part of the brain that involves spatial memory and navigation.
Why? There is something we can learn from this?
The tournament of <unk> <unk> is running as a armed race in where every year has come up with a new way of remembering more things, and then the rest of competitors have to get a day.
This is my friend Ben <unk> three times memory memory.
In his desk, in front of him, there are 36 <unk> of <unk> <unk> who is about to try to memorize an hour, using a technique that he invented and just <unk>
He used a similar technique to memorize the <unk> <unk> <unk> digits <unk>
<unk> Yes.
And as there is a huge amount of ways to remember things in these competence, absolutely all the techniques by the end of the end of the end are called <unk> <unk>
This is illustrates by a elegant paradox known as the <unk> paradox -- he says this: I tell two people who remember the same word. I say to you, <unk> that there's a man named <unk>
That's his <unk>
And then I'm asking you, <unk> there is a <unk> <unk>
And when I go back later, and I ask them to give them that word I told them a <unk>
<unk> which <unk>
The person who was told that their name is Baker is unlikely to remember the same word that the person who was told that their job is <unk>
The same word, different <unk> <unk> that is weird.
What about here?
Well, the name Baker, doesn't really mean anything to you. It doesn't have any relationship to you.
With all the other memories that dance for his head.
But the word, <unk> We know <unk>
They wear <unk> <unk>
They have <unk>
It's good when they come home to work.
Probably <unk> some <unk>
And when we got that word for the first time, we started putting <unk> <unk> to <unk> them at some end of it.
One of the most elaborate techniques to do this goes back two years ago in the Greece <unk>
It's known as the <unk> of <unk>
The story comes like this: There was a poet called <unk> that I attended a <unk>
They had hired him as entertainment, because earlier, if I wanted to take a very good party, you wouldn't take a <unk> <unk> to a <unk>
He put up on foot, <unk> his memory poem, and he was <unk> and as soon as it was, the hall was <unk>
<unk> everybody.
But not only killed everybody, but <unk> the <unk> bodies of <unk>
Nobody could say who was there, nobody could remember where they were sitting.
And so they couldn't afford the <unk>
A tragedy behind the other.
<unk> standing outside the only surviving in the middle of the rubble, I closed the eyes and realized that with the eyes of his mind, I could see where I had been sitting every here."
He took the family <unk> where their loved ones were in the rubble.
So what you have to <unk> we've discovered this moment is something that we all know about or less <unk> and it is that no matter whether we're not good to remember names or <unk> or instructions for word of our colleagues, we have visual memory and an extraordinary space of the <unk>
If I tell you that I would tell you the first 10 words of the story that I just tell you about <unk> it's very likely to find them very difficult to do it.
But I would bet, if you tell them who you say who was sitting on the horse is brown <unk> in your <unk> would be able to <unk>
The idea of the palace of memory is to create this building with the eyes of its mind and images of images with the things that you want to remember. And the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> is the picture, more <unk>
This is a advice that comes from over 2,000 years ago, to the first <unk> <unk> in <unk>
And how does it work?
Let's say you guys have been invited to the TED stage to give a talk and you want to make it memory in the same way that I would have done it -- if you had been invited to <unk> 2,000 years ago.
What you could do is imagine you're at the door of your house.
And they come up with some kind of an absolutely ridiculous <unk> crazy and <unk> to help them remember that the first thing they want to mention is that completely <unk> competition.
And then you can imagine moving into your house, and seeing the <unk> of the <unk> on <unk>
And you remember that they want to introduce your friend Ed <unk>
And then you would see Britney <unk> to remind you that funny anecdote that you want to count.
And then they entered the kitchen, and the fourth subject that would talk to be that strange journey that they did for a whole year, and have some friends to help them remember it.
This is how speakers <unk> <unk> their narratives -- not word for the word to confuse it for a typical one.
In fact, the term <unk> comes from the Greek <unk> which means <unk>
It's a <unk> of when people thought about <unk> and in the rhetoric with this sort of spatial terms.
The phrase <unk> <unk> would be like the first place in his palace of memory.
I saw this was just fascinating, and I got to get filled with that.
I went to some of these memory skills, and I had the idea of writing something great about this <unk> <unk>
But there was a problem.
The problem was that a memory competition is a <unk> event.
Really, it's like seeing a lot of people sitting taking <unk> I mean, the most exciting thing that happens is when someone gets caught up the front.
I'm a journalist and I need to write about something.
I know there are amazing things happening in the minds of these people, but I don't have access.
I realized that if I was going to tell this story, I needed to try to put myself in his place.
So I started spending 15 or 20 minutes every morning, before I sit at the New York Times, just trying to remember something.
Maybe a poem. Or the names of an ancient <unk> school <unk> in a <unk> market.
And I found that this was <unk> entertaining.
I would never expect it to be <unk>
I was fun, because it wasn't just about training memory.
What it's actually trying to do is better and more the ability to create and imagine these <unk> images -- <unk> <unk> <unk> and hopefully <unk> in the eye of the mind.
And I was really excited about this.
This is me, using my standard training team for memory competition.
It's a couple of <unk> and some <unk> <unk> covered with tape <unk> because the distraction is the worst enemy of a memory memory.
And I ended up coming back to the same contest that I had covered a year before. He had the idea that I could <unk> in a kind of <unk> experiment.
I thought this could be good <unk> for my entire research.
The problem was that the experiment was out of control.
And I won the <unk> which I didn't have to happen.
Of course it's nice to memorize <unk> and phone numbers, and <unk> but actually this is not the point.
These are just <unk> tricks.
Because it's based on very basic principles about how the brain works.
And you don't need to put <unk> from memory or memorize <unk> <unk> to benefit from a little bit of <unk> about how your mind works.
We often talk about people with a great memory as if it was a gift <unk> but it's not the case.
The big memories are <unk>
At the most basic level, we remember when we pay attention.
<unk> when we focus deeply <unk>
The palace of <unk> These technical skills, are just shortcuts.
In fact, they're not even <unk>
They work because they make us <unk>
It <unk> a kind of deep processing, a kind of complete attention that most of them are not <unk> out there.
But the reality is there is no shortcuts.
That's how things are <unk>
And if there is something that I want to leave you with today is what I was going to do, the <unk> that I couldn't even remember that I had a memory problem, I left me to me, which is the notion that life is the sum of our memories.
How much are we willing to lose what is already our short <unk> <unk> in <unk> or <unk> not paying attention to being human versus us, who walks our side to be so <unk> that we don't even engage in processing <unk>
I learned from the first hand that there are amazing memory capacities for all of us.
But if you want to live a <unk> life, you have to be the kind of person who remembers remember.
Thank you.
Today I'm going to talk to you about the last 30 years of the history of architecture.
It's a lot to cover 18 minutes.
It's a complex subject, so it <unk> only a <unk> New Jersey.
Because 30 years ago, I'm from <unk> <unk> I was six years old, and I was living there at home from my parents in a village called <unk> and this was my bedroom <unk>
In the corner, since my bedroom, I was the bathroom I would share with my sister.
And between my bedroom and the bathroom, there was a balcony that gave the living room.
And there I would all spend the time on the TV set, so every time I went out of my room to the bathroom, everybody got me up, and every time I woke up and I would come back up in a towel -- I all saw me.
And I was like this.
It was <unk> not not and I hated it.
I hate that journey, I hated that <unk> I hated that room and that house.
That's the architecture.
<unk>
These feelings, those emotions that I felt, is the power of architecture, because architecture is not about mathematics, or division of areas, but of those <unk> connections that we feel in the places that we <unk>
And it's not surprising that we feel like that way, because according to the Environmental <unk> Agency -- Americans spend 90 percent of their time underground.
So 90 percent of the time are surrounded by architecture.
That's a lot.
<unk> determines us in ways that we don't even notice it.
That makes us a little naive and very, very predictable.
That means that when I show you a building like this one, I know what you were doing, you think about <unk> <unk> and <unk>
And I know they think about it so that we have in a building built two years ago by the Greeks.
This is a trick.
It's a <unk> that architects use architects to create an emotional connection with the ways we build our buildings.
It's an <unk> emotional connection -- we've used this trick for a long, long time.
We used it 200 years ago to build banks.
We use it in the 19th century to build art museums
And in the 20th century, we use it to build houses.
See, these stable, stable, <unk> in front of the sea, away from the elements.
This is very, very useful, because building things is terrifying.
It's expensive, it takes a long time and it's very complicated.
The people that <unk> the <unk> and governments, are always afraid of innovation, and they prefer to use ways that know they're going to work.
So we found up with buildings like this.
It's a nice <unk>
It's the Public Library of <unk> which ended in 2004, in my hometown, and, you know, he's got a <unk> has this round of red, brick red, which <unk> <unk> what <unk> is trying to communicate with this <unk> the children, the values of property, the story.
But it doesn't have a lot to do with a library in today.
That same year, in 2004, on the other side of the country, was finished another library, which looks like this.
It's in Seattle.
This library shows how we use media in the digital era.
It's a new kind of public equipment for the city, a place to come together, read and share.
So, how is it possible that in the same year, in the same country, two buildings, two so-called libraries, is so completely different?
And the answer is that architecture works by the beginning of the <unk>
On one side is the <unk> the architects constantly drives new technologies, new <unk> new solutions for the current living forms of life.
We just gave them and we gave them so much, that we get completely away from people.
All of the black, this is <unk> you think we feel very good, but we're dead because we have no other option.
We have to go to the other side and come back to connect with those symbols <unk>
So we do that, and we're all happy, but we feel like <unk> and so we started experimenting with <unk> we're going to swing the pendulum back forward, over and over again, so we've done this in the last 300 years, and of course we have done it over the last 30 years.
Well, 30 years ago I did a decade of the '70s.
Architects were busy experimenting with the so-called <unk>
It has to do with the concrete.
You can guess.
<unk> small <unk> on scale.
Something really hard.
So we get to the 1980s, and we started to incorporate those symbols.
It <unk> the <unk> in the other direction.
We take those shapes we know that like and <unk>
<unk> <unk> and we add <unk> and we use new materials.
I love it.
We don't give <unk>
We took <unk> <unk> and we turned them in skyscrapers that can be <unk> <unk>
The shapes are <unk> they won in boldness and <unk>
<unk> became columns.
<unk> grew up to the size of buildings.
nuts.
But it was the 1980s, that was great.
We all spent the time in commercial centers, we moved into the suburbs, we can create our own erotic <unk>
Those fantasies could be <unk> to French or French or Italian.
Maybe with a <unk> of <unk>
This is what happens with <unk>
This is what happens with symbols.
They're easy, they're cheap, because instead of creating new spaces, we recreating memories of other places.
I know very well, and you all know, this is not the <unk>
This is Ohio.
Architects feel frustrated and we started to swing the pendulum again in the other direction.
In the '80s and early '90s, we started experimenting with the so-called <unk>
<unk> the <unk> symbols now we have new <unk> design techniques in the computer, and we found out with new <unk> a few ways that are <unk> against other ways.
This is academic and <unk> and it's super <unk> You're totally <unk>
Normally, the <unk> <unk> again in the opposite direction.
But then, something <unk>
In 1997, it opened this building.
It's the <unk> of Frank <unk>
This building changed fundamentally the relationship of the world with architecture.
Paul <unk> said that Bilbao was one of those rare times when critical and public critics and general public, were completely <unk>
The New York Times Times <unk> this <unk>
The tourism in Bilbao grew up in a half thousand percent when they finished the building.
So all of a sudden, everybody wanted one of those <unk> Los Angeles, Seattle, Chicago, New York, Cleveland, <unk>
Everybody wanted one, and Gehry was everywhere.
He was our first star.
But how is it possible that these shapes, wild and <unk> how it is possible that it becomes ubiquitous around the world?
And it happened, because the media <unk> around them, and we quickly learned that these shapes meant culture and <unk>
We've created an emotional reaction to these forms.
The same thing made the major mayors in the world.
So everybody believed that if they had these forms, they had culture.
This phenomenon at the beginning of the new millennium, happened to another star.
He went to <unk> and <unk> and what happened to these few elite architects on the threshold of the new millennium, actually started to go through all architecture, digital media began to increase the speed of information consumption.
And think, for example, how they consume architecture.
A thousand years ago, you'd have to have walked to the next town to see a building.
The transportation is <unk> they can take a boat, a plane, can be <unk>
<unk> technology. You can see in the newspapers, on TV, and in the end, all of us are photographers of architecture, and the building is pushed beyond their physical location.
Architecture is everywhere, that means that the speed of communications has finally reached the speed of architecture.
Because architecture moves so fast.
It doesn't have a long time to think about a building.
It takes a lot of time to build a building, three or four years, and at that time, an architect can design two, eight, or 100 buildings -- before I know if the one I designed four years ago was a success or not.
Because there has never been good feedback in architecture.
This is how we found out of buildings like this.
The <unk> was not a <unk> movement.
For 20 years, we were building buildings like this because we had no idea how much <unk>
That will never go back to happen. Because we're on the threshold of the largest revolution in architecture from the invention of <unk> and steel or the lift, and it's the media revolution.
My theory is that when you apply to media, it starts to swing increasingly fast, until we get on both extremes of <unk> and <unk> effectively the difference between innovation and symbol, between us, architects and you, the public.
We can now make <unk> symbols with emotional <unk> of something completely new.
I'll show you how the system works on a project that my company ended up recently.
We were <unk> to replace this building that <unk>
This is the center of a village called <unk> in <unk> Island, in the state of New York.
It's a vacation.
But that meant that two years before the building, the building, was already part of the community, and as the drawings looked exactly the exactly surprises.
The building came to be part of the community. That first summer, when people began to come and share it in social media, the building stopped being a building turned into a media, because these are not just images of a building, are the images that you made of the building.
And as you use it to tell your story, they become part of the personal narrative, and that makes us <unk> with collective memory, and by carrying these symbols, we learn.
I mean, we don't need the Greeks tell us how to think of architecture.
We can tell each other what we think of architecture, because digital media hasn't only changed the relationship between us, but that has changed the relationship between us and buildings.
Think for a second in those librarians of <unk>
If that building has built up today, first <unk> Internet to search for <unk> <unk>
<unk> bombarded with examples of <unk> of innovation, what can be a library.
That's <unk>
<unk> that can lead to the mayor of <unk> to the people of <unk> and saying that there is no answer to what a library is today.
Let's be part of this.
This abundance of solutions gives freedom to experiment.
It's all different now.
Architects are no longer those mysterious creatures that use words <unk> and complicated, and you are no longer a <unk> audience that doesn't embrace something that hasn't seen before.
Architects can listen, and you can't listen, by architecture.
That means the pendulum <unk> from one style to another, is irrelevant.
In fact, we can go ahead and find right solutions to the problems facing society.
This is the end of the history of architecture, and it means that the buildings in the morning will be very different than the buildings today.
This means that a public space in the ancient city of <unk> can be only and adapted to the measure of a modern city.
That means that a stadium in Brooklyn may be that, a stadium in Brooklyn, and not a bad <unk> historical brick based on ideas of what should be an <unk>
That means some robots will be able to build our buildings, because we finally will be ready for the ways that are going to produce.
That means that buildings become <unk> of nature and not the opposite.
This means that a <unk> garage in <unk> Beach, Florida, can also serve to do sport or to <unk> or even one can get married at night.
That means that three architects may dream of swimming on the East Side of New York, and a half million dollars of the <unk> community around that cause, is no customer alone.
It means that no building is too small for innovation, like this little pavilion of <unk> so <unk> and <unk> like the animals that are going to see.
Because no matter whether it's a cow or a robot who builds our buildings.
It doesn't matter how we built, which matters is what we build.
Architects already know how to make more <unk> smarter and more kind.
We've been waiting for all of you to you.
Finally, we're not on opposite side.
Find an architect, <unk> and <unk> together to make better buildings, better cities, for a better world, because there's a lot of play.
Buildings don't only reflect our society, but they give the way to the most <unk> local spaces, the local libraries -- the homes where we form our kids, and the step of the bedroom to the bathroom.
Thank you very much.
This is my <unk> <unk>
It just started walking.
And it does that in that great way, typical of the children of a year, <unk> as if his body was moving too fast for his legs.
It's totally <unk>
And one of the things that you like to do for the moment is <unk> in the mirror.
She really loves his reflection.
It's laughing and <unk> and he gives itself those big kisses and <unk>
It's beautiful.
And apparently, all of his friends do this and my mom tells me that I used to do it. And he made me think, when's a couple of doing this?
How do we suddenly aren't comfortable with our <unk>
Because, apparently, we don't like it.
Every month, 10,000 people are looking for <unk> "I'm <unk>
This is <unk> it's 13 years old and lives in <unk>
And as any teenager just wants to be liked and fit in.
It's Sunday at night.
It's preparing for next week in school.
It's a bit of fear, it's a little bit confused because, despite his mom telling him the whole time that it's beautiful, every day in school, someone tells me it's ugly.
What his mom tells him and what his friends, or colleagues of school say, doesn't know who to believe.
So a video of her own, he publishes it on YouTube, and begs others who please leave a <unk> "I'm nice or <unk>
Okay, so far, <unk> has gotten over 13,000 <unk>
Some of these are so <unk> that it's not even worth thinking about them.
We talk about a healthy and normal teenager, who receives these answers on one of the stages of their life more vulnerable life.
Thousands of people are publishing videos like this, mostly teenage girls trying to communicate this way.
But what is it going to do this?
Well, adolescents today are almost never alone.
They're under pressure to be online and available all the time, talking, <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> -- this never ends.
Never before we've been so connected, in a continuous way, so young <unk>
As a mother said to me, "It's just like there's a party in your room -- all the <unk>
There's just no privacy.
And the social pressures that go from hand with that are <unk>
This environment is always connected to our children to <unk> based on the number of things that they have and the kinds of comments that they get.
There's no divide between a life online and real life.
It's really hard to know the differences between what it's real or what it is.
And also, it's very difficult to know the difference between what's authentic and what is that digitally.
What is the most <unk> in someone's life in front of what normal is in a daily context.
And where are they looking for <unk>
Well, you can see the kind of images that are <unk> from the news news <unk>
<unk> size is <unk> our <unk>
The <unk> technique is now routine.
And trends like, <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk>
For those of you who <unk> <unk> it means <unk>
These trends are associated with women in the popular culture of today.
It's not hard to see what the young <unk>
But kids are not immune to this.
Like the <unk> stars of sport, and the singers <unk>
But what's the problem with all this?
Well, we certainly want our kids to grow healthy and be <unk> individuals.
But in a culture that is obsessed with the image, we are teaching our kids to spend more time and mental <unk> to their appearance, to the price of all other aspects of their identity.
Things like their own relationships, the development of their physical capacities.
Six out of 10 girls prefer not to do something because they think they don't see good enough.
These are not <unk> activities.
They are fundamental activities for their growth as human beings, and how we taxpayers to society and the business development field.
31 percent, almost one of three teenagers are not interested in <unk> <unk> engaging in the classroom because they don't want to attract attention to their physical <unk>
One out of five are not attending classes for the days when you don't feel comfortable about it.
And in the test season if you don't think that you look good enough, if you don't think you're good enough -- you have a lower note to the average note from the average of your fellow who don't care about how it looks like.
And this phenomenon has been widespread in Finland, America and China.
And it gives it irrespective of what actually weigh these young people.
So in order to be clear, we are talking about how you see you, not about how you are.
The low self-esteem on its body is <unk> the academic performance.
And it's also <unk> health.
The adolescents with little self-esteem do less physical activity, they eat less fruit and vegetables, them involved in more diet that can take you to a food <unk>
They have low self-esteem.
They're more easily <unk> by the people around them and are at greatest risk of depression.
And we think it's all about this for what they make more <unk> decisions like alcohol consumption and drugs, <unk> <unk> <unk> sex at the early ages of early ages and without protection and reproductive damage.
The pursuit of the perfect body is burning into the health system, and our government costs billions of dollars every year.
And we're not <unk>
Women believe that they're <unk> again, regardless of whether they have or don't have higher rates of <unk>
On 17 percent of women don't present to a job interview in a day where they don't feel safe in the way they see.
Think for a moment in what this is doing to our economy.
If we could overcome this, what would that <unk>
<unk> this potential is in interest for each of us.
But how do we do that?
Well, speaking, it doesn't take you too far.
It's not enough.
If you really want to change things, you have to do something.
And we've learned that there are three key <unk> The first is that we have to instill trust in your own body.
We need to help our teenagers develop strategies to overcome the pressure of perfect images and build their self-esteem.
The good news is there are many programs available to it.
The bad news is that most of these don't work.
And I was really surprised when I learned that a lot of <unk> programs without realizing the situation.
So we need to make sure that the program that our children follow is not only going to be positive, but also a <unk> impact.
And research studies show that the best programs focus on six key areas, and the first is the influence of family, friends and relationships.
These six ways are starting points for any willing to provide an education on our body self-esteem to work.
One education is fundamental -- but facing this problem requires each of us to take charge on the issue and let's be a better model to follow women and girls in our own lives.
We challenging the current status of how women are seen, and I mentioned in our circles.
It's not good to have the contribution to our politicians on <unk> or the size of their <unk> or the size of their <unk> or <unk> that will determination or the success of an Olympic athlete on the fact that it's not a great beauty.
We need to begin to judge people to judge people because they are, not because they can see.
All of us can begin by doing it by assuming the responsibility for the kind of images and a comments that we published in our social networks.
We can encourage people based on their effort and their actions and not in their appearance.
And let me ask you -- When did it last time you <unk> a <unk>
In short, we have to work together as communities, as governments and companies and businesses, to change truly our culture, so that our children will grow to valuing their entire person, valuing individuality, diversity, <unk>
We have to put people who are really making the difference in a <unk>
Just to make a difference in the real world, let's make them go out on the big screen, because we just create a different world.
A world where our children are free to become the best version of themselves, where the way they believe that they are never seeing the <unk> of being the people who are, or to reach what they want in their lives.
Think about what this can mean for someone in your life.
Who is in mind?
<unk>
<unk>
<unk>
<unk> <unk>
It could be simply the woman who is two yards away from a distance. What would it mean for her if he was liberated from that voice <unk> in his interior, <unk> that he was <unk> by not having long legs -- <unk> more <unk> a <unk> feet <unk>
What would it mean for her if we were <unk> this, and we would allow its potential to do that way?
Right now, the obsession of our culture with the images is <unk> to all.
But let's push our kids the truth.
<unk> that the way you see you is just a part of your identity, and that the truth is that we love them for those who are and therefore they do, and because they make us feel.
We <unk> our self-esteem in the <unk> of our schools.
Let's change each of us, the way we talk about and compared to other people.
And <unk> together as a community, from small groups to governments, so that the small <unk> of a year of age today, becoming in agents of insurance change in themselves tomorrow.
So let's just do it.
On the fifth of November 1990, a gentleman named <unk> <unk> entered a hotel in Manhattan and killed the rabbi <unk> <unk> the leader of the Defense <unk>
<unk> initially was being naive, but being a prisoner for other <unk> <unk> people started to plan out of about 12 icons in New York City, including <unk> <unk> and the U.N. <unk>
Fortunately, those plans <unk> by an FBI <unk>
Sadly, the <unk> bomb bomb in the World Trade Center, was unable to <unk>
Later on, <unk> would be convicted of their participation in that <unk>
<unk> <unk> is my father.
I was born in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, in 1983, being a <unk> engineer with an American mother, elementary school teacher school in the course of giving me a happy childhood <unk>
Only when I was seven years old, our family started to change.
My father taught me a form of Islam, that very few, even most Muslims -- they get to know.
I saw that when people take time to interact with it not much to want to want the same things in life.
However, in all of religion in all human group, there is always a small fraction of people who are <unk> so <unk> to their convictions that think we have to use all the possible media so they all live as them.
A few months before the arrest of arrest himself sat with me and explained that in the last few week, he and some friends, had been going to training in Long Island, to practice.
He told me that I would go with him the next day.
We got to the <unk> <unk> which, without knowing our group, was <unk> by the FBI.
When I touched my <unk> my father helped me hold the <unk> on my shoulder and explained how to point to about 30 feet.
That day, with the last bullet that he shot was given to the little orange light on the goal and, for surprise of all, especially me, the whole goal broke on fire.
My uncle turned back to the rest and in Arabic, he said <unk> <unk>
As a parent, a child.
All of all, the comment -- the comment was a lot of laughter. But only a few years later I understood what they seemed so funny.
Did you see in me, the same level of destruction that my father could <unk>
Those people later would be convicted of place by putting a van <unk> with 700 kilos of explosives in the underground parking lot in the World Trade Center, causing a explosion that killed six people and hurt other 1,000.
I admired those men.
He called them <unk> which means uncle.
When I turned 19, I had moved to 20 times. That instability during my childhood I didn't let me do a lot of <unk>
Every time I started feeling comfortable about somebody already was time to pack and go to another city.
As I was always a new face of the class that was often a victim of <unk>
<unk> secret my identity to avoid being the white. But it will be the new of the <unk> quiet and <unk> was enough <unk>
So most of the time I spent home reading books, watching TV, or playing video games.
For these reasons they didn't develop social skills, to say <unk> <unk> to grow under <unk> wasn't prepared for the real world.
It <unk> me opera to judge people, <unk> <unk> as their race or their religion.
So how could I open the eyes?
One of the first experiences that they put to test my mind is during the presidential elections.
In a <unk> program where I participated in the National <unk> Convention in Philadelphia.
My group went into the subject of juvenile violence, as I had been a victim of <unk> almost my whole life, was something that I felt a lot of passion.
The members of this group came from various <unk>
One day, at the end of the <unk> I discovered that one of the kids we had made friendship, was Jewish people.
I took several days to go out to the light that I realized that there was no <unk> between the two.
I had never had a Jewish friend before, and frankly I felt very proud to be able to beat the barrier that my whole life had made me believe it was <unk>
Another crucial moment came when I got a summer work in the Bush <unk> a <unk> park.
I found people from all sorts of beliefs and cultures. That experience was fundamental in the development of my character.
My whole life had taught me that <unk> was a sin and, by extension, all gay people were bad <unk>
I happened to have a chance to work with gay actors there, in a show, and I could see that several of them were the kinder and less critics that I had seen in life.
Having been <unk> as a child, I developed a sense of empathy to the suffering of others, but it wasn't easy for me to treat <unk> people, exactly the way I wish to be treated.
And so I was able to contrast the stereotypes that I had taught me as a child, with the experience of interaction in real life.
I don't know what it is to be homosexual but I know what it is to be judged by something beyond my control.
Then came the <unk> <unk>
Every night, Jon Stewart made me <unk> honest with respect to my <unk> and helped me see that race of people, religion or sexual orientation, has nothing to do with character.
In many ways, he became my <unk> figure on a moment when I was desperately <unk>
Sometimes the inspiration can come from the unexpected. And that a Jewish comedian would have had a better influence in my life than my own father, <unk> wasn't in vain.
One day I had a conversation with my mother about how I was changing my thinking, and she told me something that <unk> in my heart forever, while he's alive.
She looked at me with your eyes tired of somebody who has suffered enough of endless <unk> and said, "I'm tired of <unk>
At that time, I realized how much negative energy you need to keep all of that hatred on your inside.
My real name is not <unk> <unk>
It changed when my family decided to break the relationship with my father and start a new life.
So why did I go out and put myself in a possible risk?
Well, it's simple.
I've done it because I hope that someone, one day, who is going to take the violence, you can hear my story and understand that there is a better way, that even though I was encouraged to this violent ideology and <unk> I didn't get to me <unk>
On the contrary, I decided to use my experience to fight terrorism and <unk>
I do it by the victims of terrorism and for their loved ones, for the terrible pain and the losses that terrorism has been produced in their lives.
By the victims of terrorism as terrorism to speak against those acts of <unk> as a rejection of the actions of my father.
So with this <unk> I put up here as proof that violence is not inherent to any religion or race. That the children don't have to follow the roads from their parents.
I'm not my father.
Thank you.  Thank you all.  Thank you.  Thank you very much.
Right now there is a film that projects in their minds.
It's an incredible movie <unk>
It's in 3D, and it has <unk> sound of what you hear and see right now. But that's just the beginning.
Your movie has tastes and texture.
It feels your body, your pain, your <unk> your pleasure.
It has emotions, anger and happiness.
It's memories, as moments of your childhood that project before your eyes.
And they have constantly a <unk> voice, in your flow of conscious thinking.
The heart of the movie is you who experience everything live.
This film is your flow of consciousness, the subject of the experience of the mind and the world.
Consciousness is one of the fundamental truths about the existence of the human being.
Each of us is conscious.
We all have an inner movie, you, you and you.
There's nothing to make more directly.
At least, I know I have an <unk>
I have no certainty that you are conscious.
Consciousness is also the reason to live.
If we weren't conscious, nothing in our lives would make sense or value.
But at the same time, it's the most mysterious phenomenon of the universe.
Why are we <unk>
Why do we have these films <unk>
Why are we not just robots that we get to do to produce outcomes without experiencing the movie <unk>
Right now, nobody knows the answers to those questions.
I suggest that to integrate consciousness to science, you need some radical ideas.
Some people say it's impossible a science of consciousness.
<unk> by nature, is objective <unk>
<unk> by nature, is <unk>
So there can never be a science of consciousness.
Because during most of the 20th century, I would take that vision.
Psychology is studying <unk> behavior, which is studying the <unk> brain, but nobody ever mentioned consciousness.
Even 30 years ago, when TED began, there were very few scientific jobs about consciousness.
<unk> 20 years ago, everything started to change.
<unk> like Francis Crick and physicists like Roger <unk> said, <unk> is the moment for science to <unk> <unk>
And since then, there was a real bang, a flowering of the scientific work on consciousness.
And this work was fantastic. It was great.
But it also has fundamental limitations to the moment.
The center of the science of consciousness in recent years was the pursuit of <unk> correlations between some areas of the brain and some states of consciousness.
We saw some of these kinds of fantastic work that I presented Nancy <unk> a few minutes ago.
Now we understand much better, for example, areas of the brain that are related to the conscious experience of seeing faces or feeling pain or feeling happy.
But this is still a <unk> science.
It's not a <unk> science.
We know that these areas of the brain are related to certain types of experience, but we don't know why.
So I would like to explain that this kind of work of neuroscience responds to some questions that we want to explain consciousness. The questions about what are they doing certain areas of the brain and what they are <unk>
But in a sense, those are the easy problems.
Not <unk> <unk>
There is no easy problems with consciousness.
Well it doesn't address the real mystery of this <unk> why all of the physical process in the brain has to be accompanied by consciousness?
Why is there an internal <unk>
Right now, we can't understand it.
And you may say, let's give it a few years to neuroscience.
It's going to become another emerging phenomenon like <unk> like <unk> like life, and we're going to find <unk>
The typical <unk> are all emerging behaviors, how do we operate <unk> how they work, how they <unk> how they adapt and <unk> the living organisms -- these are all questions about how it works.
That could be applied to the human brain to explain some behaviors and the functions of the human brain as a <unk> phenomenon -- how we speak, how we speak, are all questions about behavior.
But when it comes to consciousness, the questions about behavior are between easy problems.
But the hard problem is the question of why it's all accompanied by a <unk> experience.
And here it is, the standard paradigm of the <unk> the standard paradigm of neuroscience, actually still doesn't have a lot to say.
I'm a <unk> science.
I want a scientific theory of <unk> that work. For a long time, was beating my head against the wall looking for a theory of consciousness in <unk> terms that would work.
But at the end I got to the conclusion that that didn't work for <unk> reasons.
I think we get stuck at this point.
We have a form of wonderful, cool explanations -- we get used to this, the physics explains chemistry, chemistry explains biology, biology explains the psychology.
But consciousness doesn't seem to fit into this scheme.
On the one hand, it's a fact that we are conscious.
On the other, we don't know how to handle that idea to our scientific <unk>
I think that consciousness, right now, is a kind of <unk> something that we need to integrate into our view of the world, but we don't know how.
With an anomaly like this, you can need radical ideas, I think we need ideas that at first, crazy enough before we can deal with consciousness in a scientific way.
There are some possibilities for those crazy ideas.
My friend Dan Dennett, which is here today, has one.
And his crazy idea is that there's no such hard problem of consciousness.
The whole idea of the subjective movie includes kind of an illusion or confusion.
Actually, what you need to do, is to explain the functions -- <unk> the behaviors of the brain, and so it is studies everything that needs <unk>
Well, more power for him.
That's the kind of radical idea that we need to explore if we want to have a theory of purely <unk> <unk> based on the brain.
At the same time, for me and for many others, that vision is pretty close to simply deny that the observation of consciousness is satisfying.
But I'm in a different direction.
In the time that I have -- I want to explore two crazy ideas that I think can be <unk>
The first crazy idea is that consciousness is critical.
We physicists sometimes take some aspects of the universe as <unk> <unk> space and mass.
<unk> fundamental laws that <unk> like the laws of gravity or quantum mechanics.
These laws and fundamental properties don't explain in terms of anything else.
Instead, they look like fundamental principles, and there is the world.
Sometimes, the list of the fundamental is <unk>
In the 19th century, <unk> discovered that you can't explain electric phenomena in terms of fundamental concepts of space, space, <unk> <unk> law, and then I applied the basic laws of <unk> and I applied the electrical burden as a fundamental concept that those laws <unk>
I think that's the situation that we found with consciousness.
If you can't explain consciousness in terms of fundamental ideas, space, time, mass, load up, then for a question of logic, we have to <unk>
The most natural thing would be <unk> awareness as a fundamental thing, a fundamental brick of nature.
This doesn't mean that suddenly not the object of science.
It opens the path to <unk> scientifically.
So what we need is to study the fundamental laws that govern consciousness, the laws that connect consciousness with other fundamental concepts -- the space, the mass, the mass, the <unk> processes.
We physicists sometimes say we want to make fundamental fundamental laws that we can put them into a <unk>
The situation of consciousness is something like this.
We want to find fundamental fundamental laws that we can put them on a t-shirt.
We still don't know what laws are, but that's what we're looking for.
The second crazy idea is that consciousness can be universal.
Each system can have a degree of consciousness.
This vision is sometimes called <unk> <unk> by all, <unk> by mind, every system is conscious, not only humans, the dogs, the mice, the <unk> even the microbes from Rob <unk> the elementary particles.
Even a <unk> has some degree of consciousness.
The idea is not that photons are smart or <unk>
It's not that a <unk> can be filled with distress when you think -- "Oh, always traveling at the speed of light.
I never can slow down and smell the <unk>
No, so no.
But thinking is that perhaps photons can have some element of crude feeling, <unk> some early precursor to consciousness.
This may sound a little crazy for you.
How would anybody think something so <unk>
In part of this comes from the first crazy idea, that consciousness is a fundamental thing.
If it's fundamental as space, time, and mass, it's natural to assume that it can also be universal, like others.
It's also worth noticing that even though the idea seems to us, it's much less for the people of different cultures where the human mind seems more a continuum of nature.
One deeper reason comes from the idea that perhaps the simplest and powerful and powerful way of finding fundamental laws that <unk> the thinking with the physical process, is <unk> awareness with information.
Whenever there's information processing information, there's consciousness.
<unk> of complex <unk> like in a human being, <unk>
<unk> of simple information, <unk> <unk>
Something very exciting is that in recent years a neuroscientist, <unk> <unk> took this kind of theory, and I developed <unk> with mathematicians.
It has a mathematical integration of information, which is called <unk> which measures the level of information integrated into a system.
And it's supposed to be able to do with consciousness.
So in a human brain, there's an incredible degree of information integration, a high degree of <unk> a lot of consciousness.
In a mouse -- there is a level of information integration, the same kind of significant <unk> level of consciousness quite important.
But when you get to the worms, microbes, particles, the degree of <unk> <unk>
The level of information integration is less, but it's not zero either.
In the <unk> theory, there's still a different level of zero.
It actually offers a fundamental law of <unk> high degree of consciousness.
Also, another reason is that <unk> can help us integrate awareness to the physical world.
<unk> and tastes often have observed that the physics is curiously abstract.
It describes the structure of reality using a lot of equations, but it doesn't tell us about the reality underlies it.
As Stephen <unk> "Where is the fire <unk>
From <unk> vision, the equations of physics you can leave as they are, but you can use it to describe the flow of consciousness.
That's what physicists do basically describe the flow of consciousness.
According to this vision, the awareness is that he puts fire in the equations.
In that vision, consciousness is not outside of the physical world as a kind of <unk>
It's right in the center.
This vision, I think, <unk> vision has the potential to <unk> our relationship with nature, and it can have a very serious social <unk>
Some can be <unk>
I used to think that I shouldn't eat anything that was consciousness, I should be a <unk>
If you're a <unk> and you accept that vision, you're very hungry.
I think it really does it tend to transform your <unk> whereas what matters in ethical terms and moral <unk> it's not so much the fact of consciousness, but its importance and complexity.
It's also natural to ask for consciousness in other systems, like computers.
What about the artificial intelligence system of Samantha <unk> <unk>
It's <unk>
According to the vision of <unk> information, she has an integrated complicated information, so the answer is yes, it's conscious.
If this is the right thing, they are presented with a pretty serious ethical problems, quite serious about the developing computer systems and the ethics ethic.
Finally, you can ask for the collective collective awareness -- the planet.
Canada has its own consciousness?
Or a more local level, an integrated group, like the audience in a TED talk. Right now, we have a collective collective consciousness -- an internal film for this whole TED group of TED, different from the <unk> films in each of the <unk>
I don't know the answer to that question, but I think at least it's a question you have to take seriously.
So this <unk> <unk> is a radical vision, and I don't know if it's correct.
I'm actually more secure of the first crazy idea, that consciousness is a fundamental thing, which is a fundamental thing, which is universal.
The vision raises a lot of challenges, like, how do those bits of thinking contribute to the kind of complex consciousness, we know and I love it.
If we can answer those questions, then I think we're going on the right path towards a theory of serious awareness.
If not, well, probably this is the hardest problem of science and philosophy.
We can't wait to solve it overnight.
But I think we're going to finally figure out.
Understanding consciousness is the real key, I think, to understand the universe and to understand ourselves.
Maybe we just need the crazy idea.
Thank you.
I grew up in a rural village in Victoria.
He had a very normal profile, an <unk> in education.
I went to school, I was <unk> with my friends, my younger sisters.
It was all very normal.
And when I was 15, a member of my community came up to my parents because I wanted to <unk> for a community prize for the community.
And my parents said, "Well, that's very nice -- but there's an evident. problem.
She actually hasn't <unk>   And they were right.
I went to school, I had good grades. After school, I had a low-cost profile in my mother's <unk> and I spent a lot of time watching the <unk> <unk> the <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk>
Yeah, I know. What a contradiction.
But they were right.
I did nothing that was extraordinary at all.
Nothing that may be as a achievement if we take the disability outside of the equation.
Many years later, I was in the second part of teaching school in a high school in <unk> and just after about 20 minutes in the class, and I was 11 and said, "Hey, when give you your <unk>
I said, "What's <unk>
Well, I had been talking to you about the law of <unk> for good 20 minutes.
And he said, "You know, your <unk> <unk>
When people on wheels, they talk about <unk> things at school?"
Usually in the <unk> classroom.
And it was then when I realized, this child had had with disabled people as an inspiration.
And we don't are. And it's not the fault of the boy, I mean, that's true for many of us.
For us, people with disability are not our teachers or our doctors or our <unk>
We're not real people. We are there to inspire it.
And in fact, I'm on this stage <unk> what I do in this wheelchair, and you're probably waiting for you to <unk> Right?  Yes.
Well, ladies and gentlemen, I'm afraid <unk> <unk>
I'm not here to <unk>
I'm here to tell you that they've lied to us in relation to disability.
Yes, they have sold the lie that disability is something called a capital M <unk>
It's something wrong and living with a disability makes you remarkable.
It's not something wrong and doesn't make you <unk>
And in the last few years, we've been able to spread even more this lie through social media.
You may have seen images like this: "The only disability in life is a bad <unk>
Or this <unk> "Your excuse is <unk>
Or this <unk> <unk> <unk>
These are just a couple of examples, but there's a lot of them.
You may have seen one, of the girl with no hands drawing with a pencil held out of her mouth.
You may have seen a child running with carbon fiber.
And there's a lot of these pictures, which is what we call <unk> <unk>
And I use the <unk> porn -- because it <unk> a group of people for the benefit of another group of other people.
So in this case, <unk> the disabled, in the benefit of people without disabilities.
The purpose of these images is <unk> <unk> so we can see them and think, "Well, for very bad that my life, could be worse.
I could be that person."
But what if you're that person?
I've lost the case of the number of times I've been tackled by strange <unk> to express me that I am brave or a source of inspiration, and this was happening to before my work had a public profile.
It was kind of like me to get up in the morning and remember my own name.  And this is <unk>
These images that those images will inspire people with disability to benefit from people without disabilities.
They're there for you to see them and think that things are not that bad for you, or to put your concerns in perspective.
And life as a disabled person is actually a tough thing.
<unk> some things.
But the things we have is not the things that you can think of.
They're not relative to our bodies.
I use the term <unk> <unk> deliberately because I joined the so-called social model of disability, which tells us that we're more disabled, because of the society that we live because of our bodies or diagnostics.
So I've lived in this body for a long time.
I'm very <unk> with him.
It makes things that I need to do, and I've learned to get the best of your ability as well as you do, and that's what happens to the kids of those pictures as well.
They're not doing anything outside of it.
They're just using their bodies getting the best of their ability.
So, it's really just <unk> in the way we do, by sharing those <unk>
When people tell us, "You're a source of <unk> it says it as a compliment.
And I know why that happens.
It's because of the lying, because we have sold this lie that disability makes us quite remarkable.
And honestly, it's not doing it.
And I know what you're thinking.
I'm here <unk> the inspiration, and you think, "Oh God, you're not in a few times for something for something for something for something for something for something about something about something in something here.
And I actually know that I am.
<unk> of other people with disability at all time.
However, I don't think I'm more lucky than them.
<unk> that this is a great idea to use <unk> <unk> to pick up the things that fall out --  <unk> the <unk> trick of how to load the battery battery into the battery battery.
Great.
We learn from force and resistance.
I really think that this lie that has been sold about disability is the biggest <unk>
It makes us hard life.
And that quote: "The only disability in life is a bad <unk> the reason that's lie is because it's not true because of the social model of disability.
A lot of smiles in the <unk> has never made it to become a <unk>
Never.   <unk> in front of a TV screen, it will not make the <unk> <unk>
Not a lot of people in the middle of a bookstore and <unk> a positive attitude and turning all those books into the <unk>
It's just not going to happen.
I want to really live in a world where disability is not exception, but the norm.
I want to live where a 15 year-old girl sitting in his bedroom watching <unk> the <unk> <unk> not considered anything to be in a chair.
I want to live in a world where we don't have so low expectations of people with disability to be <unk> out of the bed and remember our names in the morning.
I want to live in a world where we value the genuine achievement.
<unk> does not make us <unk> but question what you think you know about what you do.
Thank you.
What do you have to see <unk> reality and professional football with the <unk>
And what is the average speed of a <unk> <unk>
Unfortunately, today I'll just answer one of those questions, so please don't <unk>
When people think about <unk> <unk> think about <unk> <unk> and Tom <unk> <unk> the hands in the air, but <unk> reality is not science fiction.
<unk> reality is something that happens in our days and will happen because we have the tools to do it, and people need to know it, because <unk> reality will change our lives as much as the Internet and mobile phones.
So how did we get to reality <unk>
The first step, is what I'm wearing the Google <unk>
I'm sure many of you are familiar with them.
What you may not know is that Google <unk> are a device that allows them to see what I see.
It will allow you to experience what is a professional <unk> in the field.
Right now, the only way to be in the field is that I try to <unk>
I have to use words.
I have to create a framework that you would do with your imagination.
We can use the Google Glass, under a helmet and know what is running through the field of play to 160 <unk> blood hitting the ears.
We can know that a man in 110 pounds -- we are <unk> trying to <unk> with everything else.
I've been there and I guarantee it's not nice.
So I had some videos to show you what it is to use the Google <unk> under the hull, and give them a sense of that.
Unfortunately, it's not images of the practices of <unk> because the idea of the <unk> of the emerging technology is a submarine going up to the surface.
So let's look at a video.
Chris <unk> Go.
It's horrible to be <unk>
A moment. <unk> a little bit.
<unk>
Go!
Chris <unk> As you can see, it's a <unk> of what's being <unk> in the football field from the perspective of the <unk>
You may have realized that we lack people, the rest of the team.
We have a video of them, <unk> from the University of Washington.
<unk> <unk> Mice <unk> mice.
Blue <unk> Blue <unk> Go!
Chris <unk> This is a little bit more like feeling in the field, but it has nothing to do with being in <unk>
<unk> want that experience.
The fans want to be in the field, be their favorite players -- and they've asked me on YouTube and in <unk> "You can see from the angle of a field <unk>
or a <unk>
We want to experience that."
Once we have that experience with <unk> and Google Glass, how we get <unk> how we take it to the next <unk>
We took it to that level using something called <unk> <unk> which probably many of you know.
The Rift <unk> has been described as the most realistic virtual reality apparatus ever created, and it's not <unk> cheap.
And I'm going to show you why for this video.
Man: Oh, Oh.
No, no, no! I don't want to keep <unk> No!
Oh, my God! Ah!
<unk> That's the experience of a man on an Russian rollercoaster <unk> for his life.
What will be the experience of a fan when he <unk> a video of Adrian <unk> across the line, <unk> from a <unk> with the arm before I run and make a <unk> What will be the experience of a fan of a fan of a fan of a fan of a fan of a fan of a fan of a fan of a fan of a fan of a
When I can be <unk> running through the <unk> launching the ball to the US network? Or I would get <unk> by doing a <unk>
What is their experience when you go from a mountain to over 100 miles an hour like a <unk> <unk>
Maybe <unk> <unk> <unk>
But this is not really <unk>
It's just virtual reality, <unk>
How do we get to <unk> <unk>
<unk> augmented reality when <unk> <unk> and owners see the information that people want to see and think, "How do we use this to improve our <unk>
How do we use it to win <unk>
Because they always use technology to win.
They like to win. It gives you money.
So, here's a quick refresher on technology in <unk>
In <unk> the Baltimore <unk> they put a <unk> to their field <unk> to play faster.
They won the Super Bowl that year.
Other teams decided to <unk>
More people saw the party because it was more exciting, faster.
In 1994, the <unk> put radios into the <unk> <unk> and then in the <unk>
They had more viewers because it was faster, more entertaining.
In <unk> imagine that it's a player coming back to your group, and you see your next move you see your next move in front of you, in a plastic bombsight that you carry on, you won't have to worry about a <unk>
It or <unk> the strategy.
You just go out into the field and <unk>
And the coaches want it, because if they don't follow their instructions, they lose parties, and they hate <unk>
If you lose parties -- you fall like a coach.
And they don't want that.
But <unk> reality is not just a <unk> strategy.
<unk> reality is also a way to collect information and use it in real time to improve your way to play the game.
How do you do this?
Well, a very simple option would be having a camera in every street corner of the stadium having a view from the top of the people that's below.
You also get information from the sensors of the <unk> and the <unk> something you're already working on.
And all that information is sent to your <unk>
The good teams will know <unk>
The bad guys will have <unk>
This is <unk> to the good teams of the bad.
So your computer team will be as important as your <unk> and data analysis to stop being <unk>
It's also for <unk> Who would have <unk>
How would it be in the <unk>
Imagine that it's the field.
<unk> the ball and <unk>
<unk> to an open receptor -- all of a sudden, a <unk> on the left of your bombsight -- you tell you that a defense behind you is going to <unk> Normally, I don't know it, but the system of <unk> will <unk>
They <unk> the area of protection.
Another <unk> <unk> you have an open power.
They <unk> the <unk> but you <unk>
And the ball loses the trajectory.
You don't know where we can land. But the receptor sees in their bombsight -- an area of grass that lights up and can change the race.
<unk> <unk> <unk> running and <unk>
The <unk> <unk> and fans have continued to move it from every angle.
This is something that will create massive emotion on the game.
I'm going to make lots of people see it, because people want to live that experience.
The fans want to be in the ground.
They want to be your favorite player.
<unk> reality will be part of the sport because it's too profitable to not be.
But what I ask you is, we want this to be the only use of reality <unk>
We're going to use it just like bread and <unk> like our <unk> entertainment.
Because I think we can use it for something else.
I think we can use augmented reality to foster the empathy between human beings, to show somebody what literally is going to be in the other person's place.
We know what this technology is worth <unk>
It generates billions of income a year.
But how much is this technology for a teacher in the classroom trying to show a <unk> how bad your actions are from the perspective of <unk>
How much is this technology for a gay in Uganda or Russia trying to show the world how it lives to be <unk>
How much is it for a <unk> <unk> or Neil <unk> <unk> trying to inspire a generation of children to think about the space and science instead of <unk> notes and <unk>
Ladies and gentlemen, the augmented reality is coming.
The questions that we do, the decisions we take and the challenges that we face, <unk> as usual, of us.
Thank you.
I was just <unk> after 23 years of service in the <unk> <unk> of California.
Most of those 23 years -- the South <unk> in the South County <unk> which includes the Golden <unk>
The bridge is a <unk> structure, which is known to <unk> by its beautiful <unk> of San Francisco, the Pacific Ocean.
Unfortunately, it's also a magnet for suicide, being one of the world's used places in the world.
The Golden <unk> Gate was opened in <unk>
Joseph <unk> a <unk> chief engineer to build the bridge, said that "The bridge is pretty much about <unk>
<unk> <unk> is not practical or <unk>
But from its openness, over 1600 people have jumped to their death from that bridge.
Some of you think that travel between the two towers will take another dimension, this bridge has been <unk> as such, so that each of you from it is released from all of your concerns and pain, and the waters that go below <unk> your soul.
But let me tell you that happens when the bridge is used to commit suicide.
After a drop of four to five to five seconds, the body reaches against water about 120 miles an hour.
The impact breaks into the bones, some of which we have vital organs.
Most of them die in impact.
The ones that no, usually <unk> in the water and then <unk>
I don't think that the <unk> this method of suicide will notice the <unk> death that was <unk>
This is the wire.
Except about the two towers, there's 32 inches of parallel steel the bridge.
This is where most people get to take their life.
I can tell you by experience that once the person is on that edge, and at its darkest time, it's very difficult to bring them back back.
I took this picture last year while this young woman was talking to a officer looking at his life.
I want to tell you with joy that day to bring it back on the <unk>
When I started working on the bridge, we had no formal training.
<unk> to channel the path through these calls.
This was not just a bad service for those who visited the suicide, but the officials as well.
We have come a long way since then.
Today, <unk> veterans and psychologists train the new official standards.
This is Jason <unk>
I met him on the 11th of July last year when they receive a call from a possible subject, <unk> sitting on the <unk> near the center.
<unk> and when I got there, I watched Jason talking to Jason talking to an official in the Golden <unk>
Jason was only 32 years old and it was flown up to here from New Jersey.
In fact, there was flown up to two times before the New Jersey to try to <unk> from this bridge.
After about an hour talking to <unk> we asked us if we knew the story of the box of <unk>
<unk> the mythology of <unk> <unk> <unk> created <unk> and sent the Earth to the Earth with a box, and he said, <unk> don't open that <unk>
Well, one day, curiosity could more than <unk> and she opened up the box.
Of course, they came up with <unk> <unk> and all sorts of <unk> against man.
The only good thing in the box was hope.
So Jason told us, "What happens if you open the box and there's no <unk>
He stopped <unk> leaned on the right, and gone.
This kind of kind and smart guy in New Jersey had just taken his life.
I talked to the parents of Jason that night, and I guess when I was talking to them, it didn't seem to be ringing too well, because the next day, the rabbi of the family called me to see how I was.
The parents of Jason had had to tell them.
<unk> death will affect a lot of people.
I put these questions: What would you do if a member of your family, a friend or loved people would be <unk>
What is it <unk>
<unk> what to say?
In my experience, it's not just to speak, but you have to listen to.
Listening to understand.
Don't <unk> <unk> or tell the person you know how it feels, because they probably won't.
Just being there, you can be the inflection point that you need.
If you think somebody is <unk> you're not afraid of <unk> and asking the question.
One way to ask you the question is: <unk> in similar circumstances have you thought about your life -- you've had these <unk>
<unk> the person in front of you can save life and be the inflection point for them.
Other signs to <unk> despair, believing things are terrible, and that they are never going to be <unk> to believe that there's nothing that you can do with <unk> social isolation, and a lost interest in life.
And I came up with this talk just a couple of days ago, and I got an email from a lady and I'd like to read your letter.
She lost his son on January 19th of this year, and he wrote this email just a couple of days ago, and he was with his permission and blessing that I read it.
"Hi, <unk> I imagine you're at the TED conference.
It must be a whole experience to be there.
I'm thinking that I should go to the bridge this weekend.
I just wanted to leave you a note.
I hope you can tell a lot of people and go home talking about it to your friends who tell your friends, etc.
I'm still quite <unk> but noticing more moments of realizing that Mike will not go home.
Mike was driving from <unk> to San Francisco to see the <unk> party.
He never got there.
I called the police of <unk> and <unk> like disappeared that night.
The next morning, two officials came to my house and told me that the car of Mike was down on the bridge.
I had seen him jump from the bridge to the <unk> of the day before.
Thank you very much for fighting for those who can be temporarily <unk> to fight for themselves.
Who hasn't been <unk> without having a real mental illness.
It shouldn't be so easy to end it.
My prayers are with you for your struggle.
The <unk> the Golden Bridge Bridge is supposed to be a passage through our beautiful <unk> not a <unk>
Good luck this week, <unk>
I can't imagine the value that she needed to go to the bridge and travel the path that his son took that day, and also the value to go ahead.
I'd like to introduce you to a man who I mean with hope and value.
On March 11, 2005, I wrote to a radio call for a possible <unk> <unk> on the sidewalk sidewalk near the north.
<unk> my bike, and he looked at this man, Kevin <unk> standing on the sidewalk.
When he saw me, he crossed the <unk> and stopped in that little tube that goes around the tower.
Over the time and a half later, I heard as Kevin talked about his depression and despair.
Kevin decided for his account that day to go back to that lane and give life another chance.
When Kevin <unk> <unk>
This is a new beginning, a new life."
But I asked him, "What was it that he made her <unk> and gave hope and life is <unk>
And you know what he told me?
He said, "You <unk>
You let me talk and just <unk>
Shortly after that incident, I got a letter from the mother of Kevin, and I have that card with me, and I would like to <unk>
"Dear <unk> Nothing erase the <unk> events -- and you're one of the reasons why Kevin is still with us.
Honestly, I think Kevin was <unk> for help.
It's been diagnosed with a mental illness, which has been properly <unk>
<unk> Kevin when I only had six months, completely unconscious of all those traits -- but thank God, we now know that.
Kevin is in order, as he says.
We give God for you.
In debt with you, <unk> <unk>
And at the end, she wrote, <unk> When I visited the General San Francisco Hospital that night, you were <unk> like the patient.
<unk> I know I had to <unk>
Today, Kevin is a <unk> father and active member of society.
He speaks openly about the events of that day and its depression with hope that his story will inspire others.
<unk> is not just something I have found myself at work.
It's personal.
My grandfather <unk> with poison.
That act, despite the end of his own pain, and the opportunity to meet him.
This is what suicide.
For most people who are <unk> or those who have been aware of suicide, they wouldn't think of hurt another person.
They just want their own pain <unk>
Usually this is achieved only three things: sleep, drugs or alcohol or death.
In my career, I've responded and I've been involved in hundreds of mental illnesses and calls from suicide around the bridge.
The incidents I've been directly involved involved -- I've only lost two, but those two are too much.
One was <unk>
The other one was a man who spoke about an hour.
So during that time, I was <unk> by three times.
On the end rate, I looked at me, and he said, <unk> I'm sorry, but I have to go."
And <unk>
<unk> absolutely horrible.
I want to tell you, though, that the vast majority of the people we get to contact with that bridge is not <unk>
In addition, those few people have jumped from the bridge, and they lived and that you can talk about it, that one percent or two percent, most of those people have said that the second they leave the railing realized that they had made a mistake and they wanted to live.
I tell people, the bridge doesn't only connect to <unk> with San Francisco, but also the people.
That connection, or bridge that we do, is something that everyone and every one of us must be <unk> to do.
<unk> can prevent.
There's help.
Thank you very much.
The world makes you be what you don't are, but inside your inside, you know what you are, and a question <unk> How do you <unk>
I must be something unique in that sense, but I'm not alone in any way I'm alone.
When I became a model that I had finally achieved the dream that I had ever had since a child.
My outside I finally struggled with my inner truth with me.
So for complicated reasons, what I'm going to refer to later when I look at this picture, I think, <unk> <unk>
But the past October, I discovered that <unk> I'm beginning.
We all <unk> our families, our religion, our society, our society in history, even our bodies.
Some of them have the value of <unk> to get rid of the limitations of the skin color or for the beliefs of those around us.
These are people who always challenge the status quo, which is considered <unk>
In my case, the last nine years, many of my neighbors, a lot of my friends, my agent, I ignored my story.
I think this puzzle is called <unk>
This is my mine.
I was recorded as <unk> at birth because of the appearance of my <unk>
I remember my five years in the Philippines, at my house, and I always wore this shirt on the head.
And my mom wondered, "Why are you always wearing that t-shirt <unk>
I said, "Mom, it's my hair. I'm a <unk>
I knew how to <unk>
The gender is always considered a <unk> but now we know that, really, is something complex, and mystery <unk>
Because of my success, I never invited myself to share my story, not because I thought I'm going to be a bad thing, but for how the world deals with those of us who want to <unk>
Every day I thank you for a woman.
I'm <unk> my dad and a family who <unk> me as I am.
Many are not so fortunate.
There's a long tradition in the Indian culture that celebrates the mystery of gender.
There's a Buddhist <unk> of compassion.
There's a <unk> goddess of the <unk>
And when I was eight years old, I was at a party in the Philippines that celebrated these mysteries.
I was in front of the stage and I remember this beautiful woman appeared in front of me, and I remember that moment as if something <unk> me -- this is the kind of woman I would like to be.
And when I was 15, when I was still wearing a man, I met this woman named <unk>
He's the head of a beauty of beauty <unk>
That night she asked me, "Why haven't you involved in the <unk>
He told me that if she <unk> she was responsible for the <unk> and <unk> and that night, he won in the bathroom, and he won in <unk> <unk> in the <unk> of 40 candidate <unk>
That moment changed my life.
Suddenly, I was in the world of the <unk> of beauty.
Not many people can say that their first work was <unk> of beauty of <unk> women, but I can.
I also met the <unk> goddess especially when they went to remote provinces of the Philippines.
But more importantly, I met my best friends in that community.
In 2001, my mom.
I was <unk>
I told my mother, "Mommy, I'm <unk>
I'm here with friends, I like to travel and be a queen of <unk>
But then, two weeks later, he called me and said, "You know that if you ask the United States -- you can change the name and the identity of <unk>
It was all I needed to hear.
My mom suggested I would put two <unk> to my name.
She would also accompanied me when I was invited in Thailand to the age 19.
It's curious that in some of the most rural cities from Thailand to do the most <unk> surgeries and safe surgery.
At that time, in the U.S., it was necessary to be done before the name and gender.
So in 2001 I went to San Francisco, and I remember looking at the driver's license with the name of <unk> and gender <unk>
It was a great moment.
For some people, their identity card means to be able to drive or be able to get a <unk> but for me I was a license to live, to feel <unk>
Suddenly my fears saw <unk>
I felt that I could conquer my dream and move to New York, and to be a model.
Many are not so fortunate.
I think of this woman of <unk> <unk> <unk>
A young woman in New York who <unk> she lived his truth, but she <unk> he ended his life.
For many of my community, that's the reality that they live.
Our rates of suicide are eight times higher than the rest of the population.
So all of the 20 of November we do a global <unk> for <unk> Day.
And I'm on this stage thanks to a long story of people that <unk> and stood in front of injustice.
These are accompanied with Johnson and Sylvia <unk>
Today, right now, I'm coming out of the closet.
I can't keep living my truth alone and just for me.
I want to do the best to help others live their truth without shame, nor fear.
I'm here -- <unk> for one day there is no longer <unk>
My deepest truth led me to accept what I am.
Will you do this?
Thank you very much.
Thank you, thank you, thank you.  <unk> <unk> <unk> a quick question.
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
My support network, my parents especially, to my family, who itself is very strong.
I remember all the times I have been to young women who have been <unk> and sometimes when they were called me and sometimes when they called me and tell me that their parents couldn't take it, I would take the phone and say, "Mom, you can call this <unk>
Sometimes it worked, and it's not. It's just gender identity, that's what is in the center of what we are, right?
I mean, we all assigned an gender to birth, and what I'm trying to do is to put on the table that sometimes it would not be block, and that there should be a space that would allow people to <unk> and this is a conversation that would allow people to have -- and this is a conversation that we should have with parents, with colleagues.
The <unk> movement is <unk> compared to the gay movement.
There's still a lot of work to do.
There should be understanding.
There should be a piece of curiosity and curiosity to ask questions, and I hope that all of you are my allies.
KS: Thank you. Very nice. Thank you.
In a lot of <unk> societies, and tribal <unk> they are usually known for their kids, but I'm one of the few parents who know the daughter and I'm proud of it.
<unk> started his campaign for education defending her rights in 2007. And when they were <unk> their efforts in 2011, when he <unk> the National Prize <unk> became very <unk> a very popular girl in her country.
Before that, I was my daughter, but I'm now his father.
Ladies and gentlemen, if you look at a look at human history, the history of women is the story of the <unk> of inequality, of violence and exploitation.
You see, in <unk> societies, right from the beginning, when being born a child, his birth is not <unk>
It's not <unk> not by your father, not by your mother.
The neighborhood comes down and gives her <unk> to the mother, and no one <unk> the father.
And a mother had a lot of <unk> a little girl.
When it gives birth to the first child, the first child, he gets sad.
When it gives birth to the second daughter, <unk> and with the hope of a son, when he <unk> his third daughter, he feels guilty like a criminal.
Not just the mother, but the daughter <unk> daughter when he grows, she suffers as well.
At the age of five years, when I should go to school, he sits at home and visiting her siblings.
Up until the age of 12 years, somehow, he has a good life.
You can <unk>
It can play with your friends on the street, and it can move around the streets as a butterfly.
But when it comes into adolescence, when it comes to 13 years old, you owe him to come out of your house without a male.
It's confined to the four walls of their house.
It's not a free person.
It becomes called the honor of his father and his brothers and his family, and if he <unk> the code of that honor, I could even kill.
And it's interesting that this source code of honor, not only affects the life of a <unk> it is also affecting the lives of male members in the family.
So this brother, <unk> the joys of his life and the happiness of her sisters in behalf of the honor.
And there's a more norm of societies that are called <unk>
It's supposed to be a good girl to be very <unk> very humble and very <unk>
It's the judgment.
The model of a good girl should be <unk>
It's supposed to be silent and embrace the decisions of their father and your mother and people's decisions even if it doesn't want to.
If you <unk> it with a man who doesn't like or if he <unk> with an old man, he has to <unk> because he doesn't want to be <unk>
If the <unk> too young, he has to embrace it.
Otherwise, <unk> <unk>
And what happens to the end?
In words of a <unk> <unk> <unk> and then gives birth to more and more <unk>
And the irony is that this mother, <unk> the same lesson of <unk> to his daughter and the same lesson of honor to his children.
And this vicious cycle continues and continues.
<unk> brothers and sisters, when Amy was born, and for the first time, believe me, I don't like newborns, for being honest, but when I was there and I looked at his eyes, believe me, I felt extremely <unk>
And so much before I was <unk> I thought in his name, and I was fascinated with a <unk> <unk> of freedom in Afghanistan.
His name was <unk> <unk> and he called my daughter so for her.
But when I was <unk> they were all men, and I grabbed my pen, and I <unk> a line of my name, and I wrote, <unk>
And when she carried out when I was four and a half and a half and a half and a half years.
You might wonder, why should I mention the <unk> of a child in a school?
Yes, I have to <unk>
You can take it for granted in Canada, in the United States, in many developed countries, but in the poor countries, in tribal societies, it's a great event for the life of a child.
<unk> in a school means the recognition of your identity and your name.
<unk> to school means that it has come into the world of dreams and the aspirations where it can explore its potential for their future life.
I have five sisters, and none of them could go to school, and they would be <unk> two weeks earlier, when I was <unk> the form of <unk> Canadian <unk> and I was in the relative to family, I couldn't remember the <unk> of some of my sisters.
And the reason I had never seen the names of my sisters written in any document.
That's why value my daughter.
What my father couldn't give my sisters or his daughters, I thought I had to change it.
I used to appreciate the intelligence and my daughter's <unk>
The <unk> to sit with me when my friends would come to see me.
The encouraged to go with me to different meetings.
And all of these values, I've tried to <unk> in their personality.
And this wasn't just for her, just to <unk>
I've been <unk> all these good values in my school to girls and kids alike.
I used education to <unk>
<unk> my daughters, taught students, forget the lesson of <unk>
I taught the students to forget the lesson of the so-called <unk>
<unk> brothers and sisters, sisters, by more rights for women, and <unk> to have more and more space for women in society.
But we met with a new phenomenon.
It was lethal for human rights, and in particular, for women's rights.
His name was <unk>
That means a complete denial of women's participation in all of the political, economic and social activities.
Hundreds of schools were lost.
The girls were banned to go to school.
The women were forced to use <unk> and let the markets.
The musicians were <unk> the <unk> girls and the singers killed.
<unk> millions, but a few <unk> and it was scary to have around those people who kill and <unk> when you talk about their rights.
It's really frightening.
At 10 years, I got up, and I got up the right to education.
He wrote a newspaper for the BBC blog, and he was offered her same for New York Times documentaries and I spoke on every platform that could.
And his voice was the most powerful voice.
It was <unk> like a <unk> around the world.
And that was the reason why the Taliban could not tolerate his campaign and nine percent of 2012, he was shot in the head.
It was a day <unk> for my family and me.
The world became a big black hole.
While my daughter was <unk> between life and death, I would tell my wife to my <unk> "I must <unk> so I went to my daughter, <unk>
And he said, "Please, don't <unk>
<unk> the cause right now.
<unk> your life in play because of the truth of peace, because of the cause of peace, and your daughter was inspired by you and <unk>
They were both on the right path and God <unk>
These few words were going to do a lot to me, and I didn't go back to ask again.
When I was <unk> I was in the hospital and I had severe pains and strong headaches because their facial nerve was cut, I used to see a dark shadow that <unk> the face of my wife.
But my daughter never <unk>
I used to say, "I am well with my smile and my face.
I'm going to give it right. Please don't <unk>
It was a comfort for us, and we <unk>
<unk> brothers and sisters, we've learned from her how to resist the most difficult time, and I'm happy to share with you that despite being an icon for women's rights and women, it's like any <unk> girl.
<unk> when he doesn't have his task.
You fight with her siblings, and I'm very happy for that.
People ask me, "What is special in my tutoring who has made so audacious to <unk> so brave and <unk>
I say, don't ask me what I did.
<unk> what I did not did.
I didn't cut your wings and that's it.
Thank you very much.
Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.
I was <unk> of the brain 18 years ago, and from that day, the science of the brain has become a personal passion.
I'm an engineering.
And I want to tell you that I've recently joined the Google group of Google, where I've had a <unk> to my <unk> the Google visualization -- but all the work that I'm talking about today about the science of the brain, I did before I joined Google or outside my work there.
So having said this, there is a stigma when you get to a brain operation.
Is it just as smart or not?
Don't be like this, you'll be <unk>
After the <unk> I was missing a part of the brain, and I had to live with it.
It wasn't gray, but it was the dead part of the center that creates important and <unk>
Immediately after the operation, I had to decide how much to make more than a dozen powerful chemicals every day, because if it didn't take anything, would die in a few hours.
Every day, for the last 18 years, I've had to decide about all the combinations and mix of chemicals, and try to <unk> them to keep life.
I've been saved over once I've saved it.
But luckily, I have a soul of <unk> so I decided to <unk> to try and get the doses of <unk> because there is really no clear map to do it in <unk>
I started trying to try <unk> and I was shocked by seeing how little changes in the <unk> dramatically <unk> my sense of who I was me, my sense of who I was, my way to think, my behavior with each other.
A particularly <unk> case for a few months, I tried a dose and typical chemists for a <unk> man and I was surprised by looking at how I think about how to <unk> my thoughts.
I was always <unk> I thought all of the time in sex, and I believed that I was the smartest person around the world, and --  of course, many times in the past I've met various kinds of like this, or maybe some versions of it.
Turns out how an extreme.
But my great surprise was that I wasn't trying to be <unk>
In fact, I was <unk> a little bit <unk> fixing a problem that I had in front of it, and it just wasn't going on.
So I couldn't deal with it.
I changed my <unk>
But I think that this experience gave me a new appreciation of men and what they have to do -- I've been doing better with men.
What I was trying to do is that we adjust those hormones and neurotransmitters and so on, it was reclaim my intelligence after the disease and <unk> my creative thinking, my flow of ideas.
<unk> thinking almost always in images, and that became my key point of the key to how you can use mental images that I use to create <unk> my ideas, if you <unk> <unk> new ideas and <unk> situations.
This kind of thoughts is not new.
<unk> like <unk> Descartes Descartes can see things differently.
They thought the images and the mental ideas were the same thing.
There are people who question this idea, and there are a lot of discussions about how the minds works, for me is simple: for most of us, the mental images are fundamental to <unk> thinking and <unk>
So after several years, I can find the point right now, and I have already lots of great great <unk> and mental <unk> very sophisticated and <unk>
Now, I'm working on how to bring these mental images into my mind to the computer screen.
Can you imagine what would happen if a movie director was able to use his imagination only to drive the world into the way?
Or if a musician could extract the music of your head?
There's incredible possibilities with this, as the way creative people can get to share at the speed of light.
And the truth is, the only difficulty of doing this is simply increasing the resolution of our brain scanning systems.
Let me show you why I think we're pretty close to reach this with two recent experiments that were done by two leading groups in neuroscience.
Both of these used MRI technology, image resonance by functional fMRI -- to represent the brain. You can see the brain scan made by <unk> <unk> and their colleagues at Harvard.
The column on the left shows the scan of a person looking at an image.
The middle column shows the scan of the brain that same individual as you get <unk> to see that same picture.
The column on the right was created <unk> the contents of the central column on the left-hand side, you see that the difference is almost <unk>
This is repeated in many different individuals with many different images, always with a similar outcome.
The difference between seeing an image and imagining the same picture is almost <unk>
Now, let me share with you another experiment. This is from Jack <unk> lab in Berkeley, California.
They managed to convert brain waves into visual fields.
So let's put it this way.
In this experiment, I showed people hundreds of hours of YouTube YouTube as they were <unk> their brains to create a large pool of brain reactions to video sequences in the video.
And then they showed them a movie with new, new people, new animals, and while they become a new <unk>
The computer, using just the brain data of scanning <unk> to show what seemed that the person was seeing.
On the right you can see the <unk> of the computer, and on the left, the video I showed you.
This left us <unk>
We are well near this.
We just need to improve resolution.
And now, remember, when you see an image and when you imagine that same picture, you create in the brain the same <unk>
This was done with the <unk> systems of biggest resolution, available today, and their resolution has increased as a thousand times in the last few years.
Now we need to increase the resolution of a thousand times more to get a deeper look.
How do we <unk>
There are many techniques to do it.
One is opening up the skull and introducing electrodes.
I don't offer myself to that.
Many of you are proposing new <unk> techniques that I even <unk> with the recent outcome of the MRI -- first we need to ask ourselves the next one, this technology will be the end of the road?
The conventional wisdom says that the only way to get greater resolution, is with bigger, but at this point, magnets <unk> only to offer small improvements in resolution, not <unk> by thousands of different as we need.
I propose this idea: instead of <unk> bigger, let's make better magnets.
We can create much more complex structures with slightly more different <unk> like making a <unk>
And why does this matter?
In the last few years, a huge amount of effort in MRI were to make big magnets right?
But most of the recent advances in <unk> of <unk> and brilliant solutions in <unk> and <unk> in the <unk> and <unk> <unk> in MRI systems.
Once instead of a magnetic field, instead of a magnetic field, <unk> <unk> magnetic <unk> on the frequencies of radio radius.
So when we combine the magnetic patterns with the patterns of the radio radio processing patterns we can actually increase in a massive form the information that you can extract in one <unk>
Also, we can then divide in layers our growing knowledge of the brain structure and memory to create the increase in the thousands that we need.
By using <unk> we should be able to measure not only blood fluid -- but the <unk> and <unk> that I mentioned and maybe even neural neural activity. This is sleep.
We will be able to put our ideas into a direct way to digital media.
Can you imagine if we could move above language and communicate directly through the <unk>
What would we be <unk>
And how do we learn to deal with the truths of human thinking without <unk>
You thought the Internet is a big thing.
These are big questions.
It would be irresistible to use it as a tool to amplify our thinking skills and communication.
Certainly, this same tool could lead to the cure of Alzheimer's and the similar disease.
We have a few choices that are going to open up this door.
Anyway, you choose a year, it will happen in five or 15 years?
It's hard to imagine that it will take much more.
We need to learn how to take this step together.
Thank you.
I'll talk to you tonight about coming out of the closet, and not just in a traditional sense, not just the gay closet alone.
I think we all have <unk>
Her closet probably is saying to some person for the first time you love, or tell somebody who is pregnant, or tell somebody who has cancer, or any other difficult conversation you have to do in life.
Everything is a difficult conversation, and although our issues can vary <unk> the experience of I've experienced and have come out of that closet to be universal.
It's <unk> and we don't like it, and it must happen.
Many years ago, I was working on the South Side of <unk> <unk> <unk> a restaurant in the city, and being there, I had to go through several stages of the intensity of <unk> <unk> not <unk> my armpits, to quote the letters of <unk> <unk> <unk> as a <unk>
And I will be slope of my <unk> <unk> and I would have <unk> my head by doing a little bit, I would tell you usually a kid -- "Hey, you're a kid or <unk>
And there'd be uncomfortable in the table.
<unk> my jaw a little bit more, I would take my coffee with a <unk>
The father <unk> <unk> the newspaper and the mother tossed a cold look at her son.
But I wouldn't say anything, and <unk> inside.
And I got to the point that every time I went to a place where there was a child between three and 10 years, I was ready to fight.
And that's a terrible feeling.
So I promised myself that the next time I would say something.
I would have that hard conversation.
So after a few weeks, I happened again.
"You're a guy or a <unk>
A family silence -- but this time I was ready and I was about to go back in the female issues on the table.  I had the <unk> <unk> <unk>
The Gloria <unk> <unk>
Even a bit of the "Vagina Monologues" that I <unk>
I then took a breath and I went down and my back and my backs a <unk> girl with a pink dress staring at what is not a challenge for a <unk> <unk> just a girl with one question: "You're a little girl with a question: "You're a little girl or <unk>
And so I took deeply back again, again, I went from <unk> close to her, and I said, "Hey, I know this is something confusing.
I have the short hair like a boy, and I saw a child, and you know, I'm a girl, and you know, as you like to wear a pink dress and sometimes you like to wear a comfortable pajamas.
I am more than a <unk> <unk>
And that girl looked at me <unk> paying attention, and he said, "My favorite <unk> is <unk> and he has a fish.
Can you give me a <unk> <unk>
And that was all <unk> "Oh, good. You're a girl.
What about the <unk> that <unk>
It was the easiest difficult conversation ever ever had.
And by <unk> because the girl of the <unk> and I, both of us were <unk> the one with the other.
So as many of us, I've lived in some <unk> in my life, and yes, often, my walls used to be a <unk>
But inside, in the dark, you can't know how color the walls.
You just know how one feels like living in a closet.
That's how my closet is not different from yours or yours or yours.
I'm going to give you a hundred reasons for why I get out of my closet to get out of their closet, but this is the <unk> the difficult thing is not <unk>
The hard thing is hard.
Who can tell me to explain to someone who has declared a broken banking thing is harder to say it's been <unk>
Who can tell me that this story that I tell is harder to tell your son of five years that you're going to give you <unk>
There's no more difficult thing, just the tough thing.
We have to stop considering what we are difficult to do with respect to what difficult to make us feel better or worse in relation to our <unk> and we have to just feel empathy because we all live a hard thing.
At some point in our lives, we all live in <unk> and you can make them feel security, or at least more security than offering the other side of the door.
But I'm here to tell you, that no matter what your walls are, a closet not a place to live.
Thank you.  Imagine for 20 years ago.
I, who had a horse tail, a dress and <unk>
He was not the militant lesbian ready to fight for any of four years that would go back to the coffee.
I was frozen in the fear, <unk> in a corner of my <unk> <unk> my gay <unk> and the moving muscle only is the scariest thing I've ever done.
My family, my whole friends, new strangers that I've spent my entire life trying to do not <unk> and now the world turned to purpose.
I was burning the pages of a script that we've all followed for so long, but if you don't toss that <unk> you kill you.
One of my <unk> <unk> <unk> was in my sister.
It was the first time that many guests knew it was gay, and when I did my Lady of herself in honor, in my black dress and <unk> walked around the tables and finally came to one where the friends of my parents, people who knew me for years.
And after talking a moment, one of the women <unk> <unk> to Nathan <unk>
And the battle of the gay story had begun.
Have you ever been in the <unk>
"Well, yeah, the truth is that we have friends in San <unk>
"Well, we've never gone there, but we've heard that it's <unk>
<unk> you know my <unk> <unk>
It's very good, and it's never talking about having <unk>
So what is your favorite TV <unk>
Our <unk> Will <unk>
And you know who <unk> <unk>
Jack is our <unk>
And then a woman, <unk> but waiting to show his support, to let me know that I was from my side, finally said, "Well, sometimes my husband uses shirts shirts at times.
And I had an opportunity at that moment, like you have all the <unk> of <unk>
<unk> could have been easy to indicate where they felt <unk>
It's not very hard to find them and realize the fact that they were <unk>
And what else do you ask someone, but <unk>
If you're going to be authentic with somebody, you have to be prepared for the authentic thing you want.
That's how hard conversations are still going to be my strong point.
Ask anybody who I have <unk>
But I'm getting better, and I keep what I like to call the three principles of the <unk>
Now, please see this through the <unk> <unk> but understand that what it involves coming out of any closet is essentially the same thing.
Number one: Be authentic.
<unk> <unk> Be yourself.
That girl in the coffee had no <unk> but I was ready for battle.
If you want somebody to be <unk> the others have to know that we also suffer.
Number two: Be <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
If you know they're gay, <unk>
If they say their parents that maybe they might be gay, they would keep the hope that that could change.
Don't give them a sense of hope.
And number three, and more important --  Let the complex.
You communicate your truth.
It will never be <unk> for that.
And some of them can come out safe, <unk> because of what they've done, but never excites me.
And yes, maybe some will feel <unk> but that's something in them, not in you.
Those are the expectations of them about what you are, but not yours <unk>
That's the story of them, but not from you.
The only story that matters is that you want to write.
So the next time you find in a dark talk, you get a <unk> you must know that we've all been there before.
And they may be very <unk> but they don't.
Thank you, <unk> Enjoy the <unk>
<unk> what is that?
If you look at the story of how intelligence, intelligence has been seen -- a productive example has been the famous quote by <unk> <unk> that "The question of whether a machine can think of is as interesting as a submarine can be <unk>
When <unk> <unk> wrote this as a criticism of computer computing as Alan <unk>
And so a few years ago, we had a program to try to understand the fundamental physical mechanisms underlying intelligence.
Let's take a step back.
First, let's start with a thought experiment.
Imagine that you are from an alien race that you don't know about the biology of the Earth or the Earth of Earth or the Earth's neuroscience of Earth, but that you have incredible telescopes and you can look at the Earth, and they have incredibly long lives, so you can look at the Earth in millions, even billions of years.
And you see a very strange effect.
Of course, as <unk> we know that the reason is that we're trying to save ourselves.
We're trying to avoid an impact.
But if you're from an alien race that doesn't know anything about it, that doesn't have any concept on intelligence on Earth, it would be forced to develop a physical theory that would explain how, at a certain time in time, the asteroids that <unk> the surface of a planet is <unk> they stop doing it.
And so I claim that this is the same question that we can understand the physical nature of intelligence.
So in this program that I conducted a number of years ago, I looked at a variety of issues through science, through various disciplines, that I believe, to a single underlying mechanism of intelligence.
In <unk> for example, there have been a variety of evidence that our universe seems to be <unk> adjusted to the development of intelligence, and, in particular, for the development of universal states that <unk> the diversity of future future.
Finally, in the robotic movement, there's been a variety of recent techniques that have tried to harness the skills of robots to maximize the future freedom of action in order to do complex tasks.
And so, by taking all these different subjects and <unk> together, I asked, asked several years ago: There is an underlying mechanism for the intelligence we can extract from all these different <unk>
There's only one equation for <unk>
And I think the answer is yes. What you're seeing is probably the closest equivalent of a E = <unk> for the intelligence that I have ever seen.
So what you're seeing here is an affirmation that intelligence is an <unk> F, which acts in order to maximize the future freedom of action.
It acts to maximize the future freedom of action, or to keep open options with a safe force with the diversity of possible <unk> <unk> Yeah, even an imminent future time, <unk>
In a few words, the intelligence doesn't like to get <unk>
<unk> is trying to maximize the future freedom of action and keep open choices.
And so, by having this equation, it's natural asking, "What can you do with this?
How <unk> is it?
<unk> the level of human <unk>
<unk> <unk> intelligence.
So I'm going to show you now a video that I think, will show some of the amazing applications of this simple equation.
Narrator: <unk> research in cosmology has suggested that the universes that produce more disorder, or <unk> in their life should have to make conditions more favorable for the existence of intelligent beings like us.
But what if that <unk> <unk> <unk> between entropy and intelligence is <unk> a more <unk>
What if intelligent behavior is not only correlates with the production of entropy in the long term, but actually emerges directly from her?
To find out, we have developed a software engine called <unk> designed to maximize the production of long-term entropy in any system where you find it.
<unk> <unk> was able to spend multiple animal intelligence, playing games of human intelligence, and even earning any money to make money -- actions, all of it without being asked to do that.
Here are some examples of <unk> in action.
Just as a <unk> human <unk> here we see <unk> automatically a pole using a <unk>
This behavior is remarkable in part because we never gave it a goal.
He simply decided for her to balance the <unk>
This ability of balance will have applications for <unk> <unk> and human assistance technology.
This ability to use tools will have applications in intelligent manufacturing and agriculture.
Also, just like some other animals can cooperate just throwing opposite sides of a rope at the same time to release the food, here we see that <unk> can make a version of that task.
This capacity to cooperation has interesting implications for economic planning and in a variety of other fields.
<unk> is widely applicable to a variety of <unk>
For example, here we see successfully playing a <unk> game against itself, <unk> its potential for play.
So here we see <unk> orchestrate new connections in a social network where our friends are constantly <unk> and it keeps very successful in the grid.
This same <unk> capacity of network also has apps on health care, and energy and intelligence.
Here we see <unk> organizing the routes of a fleet of boats, discovering successfully and using the Panama Canal to expand globally.
In the same way, <unk> is widely applicable to problems in defense and logistics and transportation.
Finally, here we see <unk> they will spontaneously discover and run a strategy of <unk> <unk> in a simulated series of <unk> <unk> by increasing assets under their management exponentially.
This ability of risk risk will have huge applications in finance, and safe.
Alex <unk> What you've seen is that a variety of marks of smart cognitive behaviors, such as using tools, walking upright and social cooperation -- all derive from one equation, which leads to a system to maximize its future freedom of action.
Now, here's a profound <unk>
Let's go back to the beginning of the use of the term robot, the work <unk> there was always the concept that if we were doing smart machines, there would be a <unk> rebellion, there would be a <unk> rebellion, there would be a <unk> rebellion, there would be a <unk> rebellion, there would be a <unk> rebellion, there would be a <unk> rebellion, there would be a <unk> rebellion,
Machines are <unk> against us.
One of the biggest consequences of this work is that maybe all of these decades, we've had the whole concept of rebellion in the other way.
It's not the machines first become smart and then <unk> and trying to take over the world.
It's all opposite, that the urge to take control of all future possible is a more fundamental principle than the intelligence, that general intelligence can actually arise from taking the control, rather than being backwards.
Another important consequence is the pursuit of the target.
They often ask me, how do you look for goals to learn from this kind of <unk>
My equivalent to that statement to go through the descendants of going to the descendants of them to help build artificial artificial artificial <unk> or to help them understand human intelligence, is the following: The intelligence has to be view as a physical process that tries to maximize the future freedom of action and avoid restrictions in its own future.
Thank you very much.
We're at a tipping point in human history, something between the <unk> of stars and losing the planet we call <unk>
Except, in the last few years, we have expanded much our knowledge of how the Earth fits in the context of the universe.
The Kepler Kepler has discovered thousands of possible planets orbiting other stars, what points that the Earth is only one between billions of planets in our galaxy.
Kepler is a space telescope which measures the faint intensity of stars when planets go through front of them, and block a little bit of that light coming to us.
The data gathered by Kepler shows the sizes of the planets besides the distance that there are between them and their stem star.
Together, this helps us understand whether these planets are small and <unk> as the Earth planets in our solar system, and also the amount of light that they receive from their <unk>
Instead, this gives it clues about whether these planets that we find are habitable or not.
Unfortunately, while we're finding this trove of potentially <unk> worlds our own planet is <unk> under the weight of humanity.
<unk> year 2014 was the hottest <unk>
<unk> and sea ice that has been with us since recently has been disappearing in a matter of decades.
These environmental changes that we've caused globally.
But I'm not a science scientist in the weather, or not <unk>
I study the <unk> of the planet influenced by the stars, with the hope of finding places in the universe where to discover life beyond our planet.
You might say that I'm looking for alien opportunities in the corporate sector.
Now, as someone really interested in finding life in the universe -- I can tell you that the more look for planets like the Earth, the more enjoy our own planet.
Each of these new worlds invites a comparison between the newly discovered planet.
Take our neighbor, Mars.
Mars is small and <unk> and despite being a bit further away from the Sun, it can be considered a potentially livable world that demonstrated this for a mission like the <unk>
In fact, it is possible that Mars has been habitable in the past, and in part, that's why we studied so much to Mars.
Our <unk> like <unk> they trace their surface into search of clues about the origins of life as we know it.
The satellites that the <unk> like the <unk> <unk> take samples of the <unk> atmosphere, and try to understand how Mars had lost their <unk>
Business companies now have not just short short space flights but the <unk> chance of living on Mars.
But even though all these <unk> images remind us of the world's deserts, places that are linked in our imagination with the ideas of <unk> and <unk> compared to Earth, Mars is a pretty terrible place to live.
Let's take the extension of the <unk> areas of our planet that are still <unk> places that are actually <unk> compared to Mars.
Even in the highest and highest places on Earth, air is fresh and packed with oxygen <unk> by our tropical forests to thousands of miles away.
I worry that this excitement by the colonization of Mars and other planets would drag to a big and sad <unk> the implication and the belief and the belief and the belief that Mars would expect to save this <unk> <unk> of the only planet that we know is truly livable the Earth.
And so I like <unk> exploration, I'm deep disagreement with this idea.
There's a lot of good reasons to go to Mars, but to say that Mars will be there to <unk> humanity is like figuring out that the captain of the Titanic will be later on the <unk> <unk>   Thank you.
But the goals for exploration and <unk> preservation is not <unk>
No, they are actually faces of the same <unk> the goal of trying to understand and to improve life in the future.
<unk> environments present in our world look like <unk> aliens.
It's just closer to home.
If we can understand how to create and keep <unk> spaces in the hostile and <unk> areas of the land, maybe we can satisfy the need to preserve our environment and go beyond that.
I'll leave you with an experiment that I would do to the <unk>
Many years ago, the physicist Enrico Fermi asked <unk> <unk> who had been around for a long time, and we hope that there were many planets in this universe, we should have found a lot of planets in this universe, we should have found the evidence of life of alien life so far.
Well, where are they?
Well, one possible solution to the Fermi paradox is that when civilizations become advanced advanced enough to consider continuing to consider between the stars, they lose the notion of how important it is to protect the origin of the planets that are <unk> this development.
It's arrogant to think that only <unk> colonization, we will save ourselves from ourselves, but the planetary preservation and exploration can work together.
If we really believe in our ability to look at the hostile environments of Mars for the human presence, then we should be able to overcome the task even easier to preserve the <unk> on Earth.
Thank you.
A few years ago, I <unk> my own house.
And while I was on the front porch looking at my pockets, I realized I didn't have the keys.
In fact, I could see the window that was at the dining table, where I had them <unk>
So fast I tried to open up all the other doors and windows, and they were all right off.
I thought I would call a <unk> at least my cell phone, but at midnight, a <unk> could take a long time to get it, and it was cold.
I couldn't go back to my friend's friend's friend's house to spend night because he had an early flight to Europe the next morning, and my <unk>
<unk> expensive, but they certainly don't even more expensive than a half at the late night, so I thought, despite the circumstances, despite the circumstances, even though I was in the circumstances, despite the <unk>
I'm a neuroscientist, a little bit about how brain works under stress.
<unk> <unk> who increases cardiac rhythm, <unk> the levels of adrenaline and <unk> the thinking.
And when I got to the counter counter at the airport, I realized that I didn't have my passport.
Well, I had a lot of time to think about those eight hours without sleep.
And I began to ask myself, if there was something that could do, systems that could put in place that we were going to say bad things happen.
Or at least, if bad things happen, you know, the probability of a total catastrophe.
So I began to think about that, but even a month later, my thoughts <unk>
I was having dinner with my colleague Danny <unk> winner of the Nobel <unk> and a little embarrassed I talked about that I broke the window, and, Danny shared with me that I'd been practicing something called <unk> <unk>
It's something that he had learned from the psychologist Gary <unk> who had written this a few years earlier, known as the <unk>
You all know what the <unk> is.
Every time there's a disaster, a team of experts come and try to figure out what went wrong, right?
In the <unk> as it explains <unk> you look at it and try to find out all the things that might go wrong, then try to figure out what it can do to prevent things out or to prevent the damage.
So what I want to talk about with you is a few things that we can do in the form of a <unk>
Some of them are <unk> they're not so evident.
I'm going to start with the obvious.
In the house, it <unk> a place for things that are lost easily.
This sounds common and it is, but there's a lot of science that supports this <unk> based on how our space <unk>
There's a structure in the brain called hippocampus, which has evolved over a course of thousands of years, to address the location of the important things, where the good, where the fish are, which places that are the <unk> trees where the tribes live and <unk>
The hippocampus is the part of the brain that <unk> in the <unk>
It's the part of the brain that allows <unk> to find their nuts.
And if you ask if somebody really did the experiment, they cut the sense of <unk> <unk> and even so they could find his nuts.
They didn't use the smell, but the hippocampus, that very evolved mechanism of the brain to find things.
But it's really good for things that don't move much, not so good for things that move a lot.
This is the reason for losing your car, <unk> reading <unk>
So at home, they put a place for the keys, a hook on the door, maybe a <unk> dish.
For his passport, it was in particular.
For your reading, a particular <unk> in particular.
If you take a place and they are <unk> with it all the things that are always there when the <unk>
What about <unk>
Take the cellphone, a picture of your credit card, license <unk> <unk> for mail in the cloud.
If these things lose or <unk> this can facilitate <unk>
These are some of the most obvious things.
Remember, when you're under stress, your brain releases <unk>
<unk> is toxic and <unk> the thinking.
