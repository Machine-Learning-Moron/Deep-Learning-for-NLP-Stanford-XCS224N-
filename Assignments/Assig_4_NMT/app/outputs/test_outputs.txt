You know what I do is write for the kids, and in fact, I probably am the author for children, more read in the U.S.
And I always tell people that I don't want to look like a scientist.
I can <unk> as <unk> or <unk> clothes, and nobody has no one has chosen a <unk>
I'm here to tell you about and <unk>
And you know that a <unk> is usually something that they fell in some place.
You have to give you the apple to see it as a <unk>
That's the painting of a circle.
A friend of mine did that -- Richard <unk>
It's the kind of complicated <unk> which I'm going to talk about.
My circle started in the <unk> school in the middle school in <unk> where I was the weird of the class.
When you go up to the <unk> every week in the heart of the kids, until a teacher gave me the life.
She saved my life to the <unk> in the <unk> of the <unk>
I did it in <unk>
About three years ago.
And I had to go out of the city.
I had a <unk> and the <unk> dollars, and I ended up in San Francisco, California -- I found a <unk> -- and in the years, I felt the need to begin to work in organizations that were born against AIDS.
About three or four years ago, half of the night I received a phone called that <unk> <unk> <unk> who said, "I need to see you.
I'm <unk> that adults never got to go.
You could be <unk> and please make that man that I know that you've already been found.
And I have to tell you that I have cancer.
Well, the day we were in <unk>
We went to see, we <unk> <unk> and we realized that she needed to be <unk>
We found a place, the <unk> and the <unk> and we get them out of their family, because it was necessary, because it was <unk>
It's something we knew how to do.
And so the woman I wanted to <unk> as the adult came to <unk> became a <unk> box and it was put on my hands.
And what happened was that the one was that the circle was used to be in a circle -- and that one of the ones that I talked about it in itself.
<unk> is that death is part of life.
She saved my life, my partner and the partner of it.
And you know that part of life needs everything that the rest of life.
It needs and beauty, and I'm very happy that today I talked about this.
You can also need to do you need to love and <unk> and it's our job to provide those things.
Thank you.
As an artist, the connection is very important for me.
And through my work, I'm trying to express them that humans are not <unk> of nature and all of it is all <unk>
I went to the first time to Antarctica about 10 years ago, and I saw my first <unk>
I was <unk>
My heart can fast, I was <unk> trying to understand what I was in front of me.
I went to my own <unk> percent of the water -- almost 60 feet. And I couldn't think that it was about a <unk> in snow on the other year after a year.
The <unk> were born when they are <unk> in the glaciers or they get the walls of ice.
Each of them has their own individual personality.
They have a different way to interact with their environment and their experiences.
Some of them are going to be <unk> to the end of the end, as the other people can't get more and <unk> in a <unk> <unk>
It's easy to think, when you see a <unk> that are <unk> <unk> and you know, in great as we see it sometimes as human.
But reality is the opposite.
As you put a <unk> I am a <unk> I'm a <unk>
As you put a <unk> <unk> water that feeds a lot of life.
I come back to photograph these <unk> as if you were the <unk> of my ancestors, knowing that in these moments of the only other moments there are the way and not going to exist that again.
It's not the death when you <unk> it is not a <unk> but a day of your way for the cycle of life.
Some of the ice of the <unk> which was very <unk> has a couple of thousands of years.
And another part of the ice has over 100 years.
The last pictures that I'd like to show you is about a <unk> that I photographed in <unk> orbit.
It is pretty easy to get a <unk> <unk>
Here you have.
You can see the left a little boat.
It's about five feet.
And I would like to pay attention to the way of the <unk> and its <unk> line.
You can see here, it starts to <unk> the boat has moved into the other side and the man is there.
This is a <unk> <unk>
<unk> of the water about 120 feet or 40 feet.
This video is in real time.
And so <unk> the <unk> shows a different side of his personality.
Thank you.
I want you to imagine two couples in the same day, exactly at the same time, every single <unk>
So, two couples every one with a baby.
I don't want you to be <unk> too much in the details of <unk> because if you stop thinking about the conception in yeah, I'm not going to pay attention.
Let's think about a time.
And in this stage, I want you to imagine that, in a case, the <unk> of the sperm and it comes to the <unk> <unk>
And in the other case, the lower column of the sperm is led to the <unk> <unk>
They both <unk> and it takes life.
I'll go to talk about them later.
In my global activity to get two <unk>
In one of my <unk> work with the story of <unk>
I am <unk> and what we study in this case is the way people are going to be <unk> the <unk> and <unk> bodies and <unk> how they have been considered <unk> the idea of the <unk> what have thought about the body.
The other role that performance in my work is the <unk> of the <unk> of patients -- or as I say, <unk> <unk> <unk> people who are daily patients who are daily patients that are daily patients who are daily patients who are daily patients who are daily patients who are daily patients who are daily patients who are daily patients who are daily patients that are patients to be
In this case, I've worked with people who are working with people who are the physical features of social borders.
I've been working for example, for example, with <unk> <unk> two people within a same body.
I've worked with people with <unk> people so much more than the age of a half.
And I've been working with a lot of cases of people with sex <unk> that the physics we don't sit in the <unk> and the <unk> <unk>
In lines we can <unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk> a lot of forms.
I'm going to give you some examples of ways to have a sex who are not going to be <unk> in the common forms of the <unk>
For example, it's the case of the individual of the individual <unk> which is <unk> which is the <unk> of the <unk> and it says to the <unk> that we all have in the life -- they get <unk>
And then, in the life of the life -- the Taliban make it <unk>
But since this individual <unk> <unk> <unk> the body doesn't care about it.
It's <unk> <unk>
So, there are high levels of <unk> but without <unk>
As a result, the body is built by the course of <unk>
When I <unk> the baby has a little bit.
It's a girl. It's a girl.
And often, it's not all the <unk> when it's growing and developing the <unk> but it doesn't have the period when somebody realize that something is happening.
And then you try to ask them to make you realize that instead of having <unk> and <unk> it actually has <unk> and a <unk>
The important thing to understand is that you can think about a man, but it's not not like that.
Women like men, we have in the body, something called <unk>
They're in the middle of the body.
<unk> <unk> create <unk> the <unk> of the <unk>
Most of the women as I said, I think a woman <unk> I don't know the <unk> structure I think it's a typical woman -- most of the women as I are sensitive to <unk>
We have <unk> and we recognize the <unk>
As a result, somebody like I has the more afraid to the <unk> that the woman who was born with <unk> who has <unk> <unk>
So sex is something complicated -- it's not that the <unk> are in the middle of the <unk> in some way you can be everywhere.
Another example: a few years ago I received a call from a <unk> <unk> and raised as a <unk> I had <unk> and <unk> relationships with her, he had a life like <unk> and I just had to discover that I had <unk>
I had a huge way of a disease known as <unk> <unk> <unk>
It was <unk> <unk> and in the <unk> the <unk> <unk> were so active that, we were so active that we actually created a <unk> environment.
As a result, their <unk> were <unk> their brain was going to be exposed to the component of the component of <unk> <unk>
He was born with <unk> nobody <unk> anything.
And it was at the 19 years when he started to have a lot of medical issues by the <unk> <unk> when doctors found that, in fact, that in fact, was woman in it.
Well, another quick example of a case of <unk>
Some people with <unk> <unk> they develop what it knows like <unk> is to say, they have <unk> <unk>
We don't know why it happens to it.
So, there are many kinds of sex.
The reason that children with this kind of bodies of bodies are <unk> <unk> <unk> or <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> is not to be able to be able to have a better mental health.
In many cases people are perfectly <unk>
The reason you get <unk> to several surgeries is that they're a threat for our social men.
The system is usually usually in the idea that a particular bias brings up a particular identity of it.
We have the idea that being woman is to have identity -- <unk> <unk> to be black -- you want to say to have the African <unk> in terms of <unk>
A terrible idea.
And when we found a body that shows something pretty different, we have problems with <unk>
So we have very <unk> ideas in our culture of <unk>
Our nation is based on a concept of <unk>
Imagine the astonishing thing that is having children who are born as two people within a same body.
The recent recent case is the last year with the <unk> <unk> <unk> put up in the <unk> of your sex in the <unk> <unk>
A lot of journalists called to ask, "What is you going to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be <unk>
And I had to tell you to explain the journalists that there is no <unk>
In fact, now we know that sex is so complicated that we have to admit that nature doesn't create a <unk> line between men and women and women and women and women and women and women and women and women and women and women and women and women and women and women and women and women and women and women and women and women and women and women and women
So what we have is a situation where the more <unk> science is that we have to admit that these categories we were able to admit that they were <unk> <unk> and <unk> directly with <unk> <unk> are a lot more <unk> than the <unk>
And not just in terms of sex.
And also in terms of software, something that turns up much more complicated than the <unk>
As we see, we put in a <unk> <unk>
<unk> for example, the fact that we share at least 70 percent of the DNA percent of the <unk>
What <unk> the fact of the fact of <unk> in just a few <unk>
And as we <unk> in the science we are getting more in a strange area, where we have to recognize that <unk> <unk> which is probably too <unk>
And we're looking at this in all of the human life.
One of them, for example, in our current culture in the United States today, they're <unk> to the beginning and the end of life.
It's hard to create a moment of which a body gets human, and it has different rights.
There are <unk> <unk> today in day <unk> not in public -- but I know within the <unk> about when somebody has been dead.
Our ancestors never had to be <unk> with this question of if somebody was dead.
As a lot of they put a <unk> in front of the nose and if it was still not the <unk>
If I stopped moving the <unk>
But today we can be able to extract a lot of a body of a body and put them into another body.
And as a result, we need to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to determine the <unk> death of all, and this brings us in a hard situation where we don't have the simple times of the past.
And you may think that this explosion of <unk> could be <unk> somebody like me.
In politics I am <unk> <unk> to the people with bodies but I have to admit that I put it away.
<unk> that these <unk> are much more than we thought about it.
<unk> from the point of view of democracy.
And to tell you this tension -- first I have to admit that I'm a <unk> <unk>
I know they were <unk> I know that they were <unk> but they were big.
I mean, they were so expensive, and it turns out in what they did that I was done that I find them every way to each other seeing that machine <unk> <unk> and not by the music, which is totally <unk>
It's why it happened in <unk> with <unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk> <unk> for me, the first activists of <unk> and I'm going to explain why.
What they <unk> was a <unk> concept and <unk> with another thing that was radical and beautiful and took it for 200 years.
And as all of all, what we all remember our <unk> <unk> was the idea of the <unk> <unk> was based on a very infinite concept of <unk>
The <unk> of the old world didn't know the DNA, but they had clear the idea of the right of you.
They had the whole concept of blood network.
It was from the idea that it was going to be able to political power by the right of the grandfather in the grandfather and then the son, so on.
<unk> <unk> <unk> that idea and they took them for a new concept -- and that concept was that all men are created the same.
They <unk> the field of game and they decided that the women who thought was the <unk> in common and not the <unk> differences that was something very simple.
And in part of it they were doing because it was part of a <unk> system where they were <unk> two things.
I was <unk> democracy and at the same time, you get the science.
And it's very clear, if you look at the story of the <unk> <unk> that many people were very interested in science and the idea of a <unk> world.
They were <unk> of the <unk> <unk> and why we get the concept of power <unk> <unk> by a <unk> idea of the right of the <unk>
They were moving into a concept of <unk>
And if you look at this for example, the Declaration of the <unk> talking about nature and the gay of nature.
I'm not talking about God and the nature of God.
They talk about the power of nature to tell them who we are.
And in a result, we were <unk> the idea of <unk>
And so to do that, they were <unk> the basis of the future movement movement.
They didn't think about that way, but they did it for us and it was cool.
And what happened.
And women <unk>
Then the success of the energy movement with people from <unk> <unk> people who said, "I'm not a <unk>
We found men in the head of the human movement, and I said, "I'm a <unk>
And again, people who are <unk> to <unk> <unk> about the <unk> difference and again, <unk>
We see the same with the <unk> <unk>
The problem is, of course, as we look at the <unk> we have to start asking what we do certain <unk>
But attention, I want to keep some <unk> <unk> in our culture.
For example, I don't want to give you a fish the same rights than a human.
I don't want to tell you that we had to be <unk> to <unk>
I don't want to say that the children of five years would have to allow them to have sex access or <unk>
There are some <unk> <unk> that for me they have sense and I think we should be.
But the challenge is trying to figure out what they are, why do you get sense.
Well, let's go back to those two people, <unk> the beginning of this talk.
We have two <unk> both <unk> to the <unk> exactly the same day.
Let's imagine that one of them, they were born about three months before the age of June <unk>
So by the contrary, he was born by the contrary, he was born in Tanzania, he was born on the one of <unk>
On the only fact that I was born about three months before Mary <unk> <unk> all of the children three months before that to Henry -- you have the right to the <unk> <unk> the right <unk>
Henry has to wait for all of that not because it has a biological age -- but because he was born later.
We find other other <unk> in relationship to their rights.
<unk> in the <unk> of being considered to be considered to be considered to say if it's <unk> in the <unk> of being considered to be considered to be considered the <unk> of the <unk> <unk>
They don't have the same rights of marriage that Henry in all states, for example.
Henry can leave them in all of the states with a woman, but Mary can marry a woman only in some states.
So we still have <unk> <unk> that in various aspects are <unk> and <unk>
And now the question is, what do we do now that the science is going to be able to make the field of the <unk> that we get to the point that we have to admit that a democracy based on the <unk> could <unk>
I don't want to give the science, but at the same time, sometimes I feel like the science is <unk>
Where do you do?
It seems that what happens in our culture is a kind of <unk> <unk> "Well, we have to fill the line in some part, so we're going to do."
But a lot of people are stuck on a simple position.
For example, Texas in a certain time has decided that to get them with a man that you have to have <unk> and that to get them with a woman there is a woman to have <unk>
Now, in the practice they don't make <unk> <unk> people.
But this is also very strange because the story I told you to the beginning of the <unk> <unk>
If we look at one of the founders of social democracy Dr. Martin Luther King in his speech -- <unk> <unk> a solution.
He says that we should tell people <unk> not in the color of your skin, but in the content of their <unk> going beyond the <unk>
And I want to say, "Yes, the idea it seems very much.
But in practice, how do you do?
How do the people in the base of their <unk>
I want to point that I'm not sure that we need to be <unk> in this for <unk> rights to people, because I have to admit that I know some of some <unk> <unk> which would probably deserve more social services, that some humans ever know.
I also want to say that maybe some of the <unk> that I know can take more decisions and smart relationships that are people to 40 them.
So how do we put in practice the subject of the content of <unk>
It turns out very hard.
And a part of me to ask what if the character of a person could be able to be measured with a instrument, maybe with a instrument, maybe with a <unk>
We want to get to that wrong.
I'm not sure where we go.
What I know is that it seems to be very important that the United States is going to be really important that the United States is in the subject of democracy.
We've been done a good job in risk of democracy and I think we do a good work in the future.
We don't live for example, in a context as the <unk> where a man who feels about the other men is <unk> in being <unk> at least that is willing to be willing to be willing to be willing to be able to live.
We're not in that situation.
I'm glad to say that we don't have a context as the one of a surgeon that I talked about a couple of years that had been done to light <unk> <unk> to then <unk> and so <unk>
But when the phone was asked the reason of the operation -- it was a very <unk> operation to me that in that other country would be very <unk> and therefore I had to do it.
And what I said, "Well, has been considered the political <unk> instead of <unk> <unk>
The United States offers huge possibilities to the people to be not <unk> to change the <unk>
So I think we have to be going to be the head.
Well, I just want to say that I've been talking about the <unk>
And I want to think how you would be the democracy, or as it might have been, if we had been <unk> if we had been a <unk> if we had been given to the <unk>
And I want to say something a little bit kind of radical for a <unk> and it's that I think you can have different ideas from different <unk> <unk> in particular if there are people thinking about group.
Since years ago, since I have been interested in the <unk> I've also been interested in investigate the sex difference.
And one of the things that has interested in is the differences between men and women in the way to think and to work in the world.
And what we know about the <unk> studies is that women, in average, they didn't know it, but in <unk> they tend to pay more attention to social relationships and to try to be <unk> within the group.
And if we think about that, we have a interesting situation in our hands.
And when I was in the <unk> one of my <unk> I knew that I was interested in the <unk> <unk> I had been interested in the <unk> <unk> I did a <unk> <unk>
<unk> what has the <unk> <unk>
And I thought, "It's the most dangerous question that I've heard.
<unk> has to see with <unk> the <unk> <unk> so there is no other <unk> in the <unk>
But the more I've thought about your question, most of me has something like the <unk>
I mean, that could be something in average, something different between the <unk> brain and the <unk> that makes us more <unk> to social relationships and willing to help the most vulnerable.
So if you look at the <unk> they were very excited to find the way to protect the people for the part of the <unk> is possible that that would be more <unk> to this concept, maybe we would have <unk> the concept of protection with <unk>
And maybe that is what we have to do in the future when we <unk> democracy beyond the <unk> to think less in the <unk> body, in terms of identity and thinking about relationships.
So as we tried to create a more creative <unk> we think about what we do about each other.
Thank you.
In the year 2007, I decided that we had to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to think about economic development.
Our new goal should be that when every family think where you want to go to live and work, have the chance to choose to each least a bunch of different cities that are <unk> to drive a new <unk>
Well, in this moment we are far from that goal.
There are thousands of millions of people in developing countries who don't have a single city to <unk>
But the amazing thing of the cities is that it's really much more than their cost cost as well.
So we can be able to be able to be <unk> to the world <unk> perhaps hundreds of new cities.
Well, this can you sound <unk> if you've never thought about new cities.
But just <unk> by buildings for <unk>
Imagine that the half of the people who would like to live in office -- they were <unk> and that the other half is still <unk>
You might try to increase the ability to make it <unk> in all of the electric buildings in the buildings.
But you know that the problem that <unk> is that those buildings and the areas that are around them to avoid the <unk> and <unk>
So it would be really hard to do all those <unk>
But they could go to a completely new place to build a completely new body, and then when the rules of that place <unk> the building instead of <unk>
So I proposed that the governments are <unk> new areas of big food <unk> to provide cities and give them a <unk> cities under <unk>
More afternoon, I learned about that more or less at the same time, <unk> and <unk> they were thinking about the challenge of <unk>
Did you know that every year about 75 <unk> <unk> and they were able to ask the United States, and they wanted to ask what they could do to make sure that those people could be able to get and make those same things in hackers.
In the summer of the summer of 2009, <unk> country for a <unk> crisis.
In the next choices of <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> with a platform where we <unk> and at the same time.
He asked them to <unk> that was his head of <unk>
As I was preparing to give me a talk about <unk>
Through a kind of process of <unk> trial and a great amount of evidence with <unk> I tried to reduce this complicated concept of cities in <unk> to their more <unk>
The first point was the importance of the <unk> as those rules who say you can't go and <unk> all of the <unk> <unk>
<unk> a lot of attention to the new technologies but it takes so much of technologies as the future of rules to <unk> and usually they're usually the rules that they buy us.
In the end of the 2010, a friend of <unk> sent them to <unk> a link with the <unk>
I showed you <unk>
They came to me.
They said, <unk> this to the leaders of our <unk>
So in December we put us in <unk> in a living room in a hotel.
I tried to explain to explain this point about how valuable that are the most effective cities, that its cost <unk>
And I used this picture that shows the value of the focus in a place like New York.
But it was a kind of kind of kind of kind of kind of <unk> and in some time, when there was a <unk> <unk> he said, <unk> maybe we could see the video of the talk <unk>
And I call the talk in terms of terms of very simple terms that a city under <unk> is a place where it starts with <unk> a <unk> that <unk> the rules that are <unk> there and a choice for people to choose if you want to go or not to live under those rules.
So the president of <unk> I called me and told me that we had to do this project, this might be the way that our country would be done.
He asked me to go to <unk> and talk about the four and five <unk>
So I took another talk full of data, which we found a picture like this, that I was going to explain that to <unk> a lot of value to a city, this has to be very big.
This is a picture of <unk> and the white line is the new <unk> which was built in <unk>
Just this <unk> <unk> over 100 miles ago.
So I was trying to convince the <unk> of that to build a new city, there is that we start with a place that we start on a place that we're going to think about the least one billion miles ago.
That's more than 100 <unk>
All the world <unk> <unk>
The faces of the audience were very serious and <unk>
The leader leader came back to the platform and he said, <unk> <unk> thank you a lot of your talk, but maybe we could see the video of the talk of <unk>
I have here in my <unk>
So I felt and showed me the <unk>
And this <unk> <unk> that a new city can provide new choices for people.
It would be a choice of a city that you might go to be in <unk> instead of hundreds of miles from the government.
And they also make new choices for leaders.
Because the leaders of the <unk> government need to be able to be able to be able to benefit from the countries that they will help help us build and make the rules of the <unk> so that they all could trust the <unk> <unk>
We went and saw a site.
This picture is there.
It could be able to be about about about a thousand miles ago.
And little later, the King of 2012, they went in Congress to <unk> her <unk> and to add a <unk> <unk> that would be able to create these special regions of development.
In a country that I had just been going to happen for this <unk> crisis, the Egyptians in Congress to be <unk> to one.
We all know all the <unk> in society, the <unk>
For <unk> in the <unk> it has to go two times in Congress.
The 17 of February was spent another time in another <unk> <unk> to one.
And after the <unk> of the age of the age of the age of <unk> a <unk> of a few 30 <unk> was to the two places in the world that are more interested in participate in the building of cities.
One of them is North Asia.
This is a picture of a new center of the city that is building in North Korea is more big than the center of Boston.
All of what you see there is built in four years ago, after that they spent four years to the <unk>
The other country interested in the building of cities is <unk>
In fact, they've been built two cities in China and they're preparing for a <unk>
And if you think about this is the point where we are.
They have a place, and they're already thinking about a place for the second city.
They are preparing a legal system that would allow the <unk> <unk> and so they would be able to focus under a different system.
A country has been committed to allow her <unk> is the night of the last <unk>
There are <unk> and <unk> of cities who are very interested in the project.
They can even get something of <unk>
But the only thing we know that you have solved is that they have a good number of <unk>
There are a lot of companies that they want to focus on the <unk> especially in a place with a <unk> <unk> and there's a lot of people who would like to go to live there.
In the world there are 700 million people who say you would like to change the other place.
There's a million the year that comes from Latin America to go to the United States.
Many of them are parents who have the parents who have to leave their family to go to get a work, sometimes they have to win the money to be able to win or buy <unk>
Unfortunately, sometimes even there are children who are trying to meet with their parents who haven't seen, in some cases, in a decade.
So, what seems to think about building a new city in <unk>
Or build a dozen of these or a hundred of these around the world?
What it seems to think about <unk> so that the families can choose between various cities that are <unk> to drive a new <unk>
This is a idea that is worth spreading.
And my friends was <unk> I asked me to say, "Thank you.
I'm <unk> and this is my <unk>
But before you show you what there is where you have -- I'm going to make a public <unk> and it's that, I live with the <unk>
I love to find, and more recently, I was going to write in my blog <unk> <unk> and different for every single time.
But I don't get something new.
All my clothes, is the second hand of <unk> markets and <unk>
Ah, thank you.
The second hand can allow me to reduce the impact of my <unk> in the environment and in my <unk>
I'm going to meet people to meet the <unk> <unk> my money is going to a good <unk> My question is <unk> and buy it it turns out on my quest to <unk>
I mean, what I'm going to find today?
I will be from my desk.
I like the <unk>
It cost less than 20 dollars?
If all the answers are <unk> so I feel that I have won.
I'll go back to the subject of my <unk> I want to tell you what I was <unk> for this exciting week.
I mean, what does you make somebody who has all that <unk>
So I'm going to show you exactly what you know.
I've got seven pairs of clothes, and nothing else.
<unk> for exactly a week is all what I've got in my <unk>
I thought it would be able to find everything else that I would like to use it after <unk>
And so I don't know about the woman that you walk on the TED <unk>   that means I found some of things.
And I'd like to show you now now the experience for this week.
It doesn't sound <unk>
As I do, I'm also going to tell you some of the lessons of life that I think or no, I've learned in this journey of not to use the new <unk>
Let's start with <unk>
I call this <unk> <unk>
You don't have to spend a lot of money to see it.
Almost you can see about less than 50 dollars.
All of the time, including the <unk> and it's the more expensive than I've used in the week.
<unk> the color is energy.
It's almost <unk> impossible to be wrong to be <unk> when you're looking at a brilliant <unk>
If you're happy, you're going to lead to other people.
<unk> <unk> is <unk>
I've spent a lot of time in life trying to be the same and at the same time.
I just know it.
If you <unk> the <unk> people not just <unk> it is also <unk>
<unk> <unk> the boy that you have in it.
Sometimes people tell me that it seems to play the <unk> or I remember his little <unk>
I like <unk> and saying, <unk>
<unk> is the key thing.
If you think you see you good with something, it's almost sure you are.
And if you think you don't look very good with something, you probably also be true.
My mother taught me this day after day.
But it wasn't until the 30 years that I really understood their meaning.
And I'm going to explain it in a few seconds.
If you think you're a beautiful person on your inside and <unk> there is no <unk>
So there's no excuse for one of this audience.
We must be able to get everything that we want to do.
Thank you.
<unk> a universal reality six words for you, <unk> <unk> go with it.
And then then finally, <unk> <unk> a very great way to tell the world something about you without having to say a word.
I've tried to take one and again, when people went to me this week just for what I was <unk>
Obviously all this is not going to go into my small <unk>
So before I went back to home, I'm going to ask you all.
Because the lesson I'm trying to learn this week is that you have to leave some other things.
I don't need to be <unk> emotionally to these things, because the back of the corner, there is always another <unk> <unk> <unk> and brilliant <unk> if there's a little bit of love in my heart and <unk>
Thank you very much.
Thank you.
This is a measure of your brain that we can divide in two parts.
The <unk> side is the <unk> part of the right-hand side that is the <unk>
So, if you <unk> a scale to measure the <unk> of every <unk> we could design a <unk> of our brain.
For example, this would be somebody who is completely similar.
This would be somebody who is absolutely <unk>
So, where your <unk> your brain in this scale.
Some <unk> for one of these <unk> but I think that for most of the <unk> of this audience, its brain is something -- with a great <unk> in both <unk> at the same time.
It's not that they're <unk>
You can be comfortable and <unk>
I consider one of those people, that the most of the other physical physics, we need a lot of logic to <unk> these complicated ideas.
But at the same time, we need quite intuition to make people really work.
How do we develop this <unk> Well, we like to play with things.
We put them to play with them and then we see it as <unk> and then we develop our intuition from that point.
And actually, you do the same.
<unk> intuition that can have developed with the step of the years is what it says that one thing can be just a place at the time.
I mean, you can sound weird to think that one thing is in two different places at the same time, but you didn't were born with this <unk> <unk>
I remember going to look at a child playing in a <unk>
It was a small kid and I didn't do it very well, always <unk>
But I notice that the play with that line of <unk> taught me an technological valuable and it's that the great things that you don't allow the <unk> and they have been in a place.
This is a great model that you can have the world, but you can be a physical <unk>
It would be a terrible model for a physical physics, that they don't play with <unk> <unk> with these strange small particles.
And when you play with their particles, you discover that they make all kinds of things really often -- as you can go into the <unk> or that you can be in two different places at the same time.
And then they wrote all these <unk> and the <unk> theory of quantum quantum
In that point that I was found the physics of some years ago, you need to make quantum mechanics, to describe those small particles.
But they don't need to describe the big objects that we are around every day.
That is not very good to me, and maybe it's because they didn't play very often with particles.
Well, sometimes play with them, but not a lot.
And I never seen them.
I mean, nobody had a <unk>
But they don't know my good part of my life.
Because if everything is made out of small particles and all the small particles are still the principles of quantum mechanics, then it shouldn't happen all the principles of quantum mechanics,
I don't find the reason why it doesn't happen.
And so I feel much better if I could somehow prove that a common object is also still the principles of quantum quantum
It's why a few years ago, I proposed to do exactly it.
And I did.
This is the first object that you can see that has been in a <unk> <unk>
What we see here is a small chip of computer.
And you can try to see the green point right in the middle.
That's the kind of metal that I'm going to talk about a minute.
This is a picture of the object.
And here's what I'm going to expand a little bit in the center.
And then here we do a very big job in the small <unk>
What we see is a little bit of a little little bit of <unk> with a way that they were in a platform.
And then I did this almost about the same way that you can do a <unk>
I went to a living room with a chip and again, and I put all the big machines around about 100 hours.
For the last material, I had to build my own machine -- to make this sense of <unk> <unk> that is under the device.
This device has the ability to be in a <unk> <unk> but it takes a little bit of help.
Let me do a <unk>
You know how uncomfortable that is being in a full of people.
I mean, when I am in a <unk> <unk> I do all sorts of <unk> things, but then when other people are going to do those things, because I don't want you to make those things, because I don't want them to be <unk>
quantum mechanics says that the <unk> objects are <unk> in the same way.
<unk> <unk>
So we knew that if we wanted to do this little bit of metal <unk> <unk> to quantum mechanics, we would have to make all other <unk>
And that was what we did.
<unk> the <unk> then <unk> a <unk> and we put it all the air, and then we put it into a single temperature of a degree on the zero of a <unk>
Now, to be just in the <unk> the small piece of metal is free to act as well.
And so we measure their <unk>
We found that in a very dangerous way.
And instead of getting perfectly <unk> I was <unk> and the way that <unk> was like a breath of this way -- as a <unk> which is <unk> and <unk>
And to give you an emotional song, we could make it <unk> and that we don't get to the same time -- something that only happens with quantum mechanics.
So what I'm telling you is something really fantastic.
What does it mean that one thing <unk> and not <unk> at the same time.
Let's think about the U.S.
In a case, all of the course of atoms that make that piece of metal are still still and at the same time, those of the atoms are moving up for the right and for it.
It's just in certain <unk> when those <unk>
In the rest of the time they're <unk>
It means that every single challenge is in two different places in the same time, which is that the fact that the whole piece of metal is in two different places.
I think this is great.
All right.
<unk> <unk> in a living room to do this for all of those years. Because look at this, the difference in scale between a only take and that little bit of metal is more or less than the difference between that little bit of metal and you.
So if you just take it in two different different places at the same time, and that piece of metal can be in two different places why you don't think about.
I mean, it's my logic part of you.
So imagine what you were in several places at the same time, how do it would be that?
How do you take your consciousness if your body was <unk> in the <unk>
There's another part of the story.
And it is when it <unk> and they put the lights and look within the box, we saw that the metal was still there in a single piece.
And I could get to this new <unk> <unk> all the objects in the <unk> actually only are these basic objects that are just <unk> in a small space.
You hear a lot about about the quantum quantum mechanics, which is all a global level.
Well, that's not so bad.
It's more than that, it's more <unk>
It's that those <unk> your connections all of the things that you are, literally define that you are, and that is the profound <unk> of quantum quantum
Thank you.
My name is <unk>
And I took 18 months -- another job in Google, until I put the idea of doing something related to museums and art to my church that is here and that allowed me to be able to do it.
I took me 18 months and I took me 18 months of it.
And so many of them and stories, it was <unk> with 17 particularly very interesting in nine countries.
But I'm going to focus on the <unk>
There's a lot of stories about why we did.
I think my own story is explains just in this slide and this is <unk>
I grew up in India.
<unk> of a big education -- I had no <unk> but I didn't have access to many of these museums and works of art.
So when I started to travel and go to <unk> I started learning a lot.
And working in Google, I try to do the desire to do more accessible through technology.
So we put a team, a great team of people, and we started doing it.
You know that it looks like to give you a couple of interesting things that we have led to it from the <unk>
So let's <unk> we're going to <unk>
Look around all of the museums that you are.
It's the island <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
I'm actually going to go into one of my favorite <unk> the museum of New York.
There's two ways to do it very simple.
We do <unk> and <unk> we're within the museum.
It doesn't matter where they are, <unk> or <unk> that really doesn't matter.
You go down there and <unk>
They want to navigate the <unk>
We opened the object, and with a only <unk> we can go on it.
They're where you want to go at the end of the boat.
Let's go back to him, <unk> <unk>
<unk>
Thank you, but I haven't come to it.
Now I'm sitting in front of my favorite paintings <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
I see the sign of <unk>
If the museum shows us the image, we do it there.
Look, this is one of the images.
Here's all the information of <unk>
For those of you who are really interested in art, you can do it, but I'm going to do it right now.
And this is one of the images that we call the technology.
So this image, for example, <unk> I think, about 10,000 million <unk>
And there's a lot of people who say, "What do you get with 10,000 million <unk>
So I'm going to show you what you really get with 10,000 million <unk>
It can be able to do a very simple way.
You see things that they're happening.
I love this man, his expression has no price.
But if you really choose <unk>
So I started looking at play, and I found me with something that happens there.
And I said, "A moment, this seems <unk>
I discovered the kids were actually playing something.
It was a little bit, I talked about some people of the <unk> and I actually discovered that this is a game called <unk> which is in <unk> a <unk> with a <unk> <unk>
And it seems very popular.
I don't know why they did, but I've learned something about it.
And now we're going to get it even more in particular and you'll see that you can actually get even the <unk>
Now just to give you a little bit of perspective, I'm going to take the image, so you'll see what it is.
Here's where we are, and this is the painting.
And the best thing is for <unk> a second.
So now we're going to go back to <unk> another time in New York.
Here's another of my favorite <unk> "The night <unk>
The example that I showed was to find a <unk>
But what if you want to see the <unk>
And if you want to see how you're going to look at how they said, I actually created this work <unk>
It is the <unk> and I really do it.
I'm going to one of my favorite parts in this machine, and I'm really going to get the <unk>
This is the night night <unk> I think there was never seen it before.
I'm going to show you another of my favorite functions.
There are a lot of things over here, but I don't have time of <unk>
This is the really cool. It's called <unk>
All of you, absolutely all, not matter if it's rich or poor, or if you have a <unk> that gives the same.
You can create their own museum, create their own collection of all these images.
It's very simple, you know, I've created this function that I call "The <unk> power -- we just just do one of us.
It's about "The <unk> of London.
You can write things, I send their friends and keep a conversation about what they feel at the <unk> these works <unk>
So in conclusion, I think that for me, the main thing is that all the amazing things is really not about Google.
No, in my view, I even don't have the <unk>
Maybe you shouldn't say this.
And actually, they come from those years.
And that has been my entire experience with this.
I mean, I hope that in this digital environment make justice to its work of art and which is represented on the line.
And the great question that do you do today is, I did this to make the experience of going to a <unk> <unk>
And the answer is no.
It's for <unk> experience.
And that's it. Thank you.
Thank you.
Good <unk> all.
I have something to show you.
Think that it's a <unk> a <unk> <unk>
In our lab, we call it <unk> design.
I'm going to tell you a little bit about this.
If you look at this picture in this picture I'm about origin of all the children in 2003, they grow with this picture in the wall of the <unk> but the reason I show you this is that has happened something very interesting in the <unk> <unk>
As a few time, if you wanted to win a <unk> career one, I took a budget and <unk> it into a good pilot and a good car, and a good car, and a good car, and a good car, and a good car, and a good car, and a good car, and a good car, and a good car, and a good car, and a good car, and a
And if the car and the pilot were good enough to you get the career.
This is what in engineering, it is <unk> system of control in real time.
It's basically a system that has two <unk> a sensor and a <unk>
Today the interesting thing is that the economic systems are starting to go into our lives.
Our cities, in the past years, have been covered from networks and security.
They are becoming computers to the air.
And as <unk> are starting to answer a different way and they can be <unk> and <unk>
<unk> the cities is big.
As you just just want to mention that cities are only the two percent of the side of the planet but represent 50 percent of the population <unk>
75 percent of the consumption of <unk> and for 80 percent of the emissions of CO2.
If we could do something with the cities, it would be a big thing.
More there, all of the cities, all these <unk> and <unk> are moving into our objects.
This is an exhibition of <unk> <unk> for the late year in the <unk> during the summer.
It's called <unk> <unk> <unk>
Well, our objects, the environment, start <unk>
In a certain way it is as if almost all of the atoms are getting sensors and <unk>
And that's changing all the interaction that we humans have with the <unk> environment.
In some sense, it's almost like the old dream of <unk>
You know, when you have <unk> <unk> the <unk> is saying that at the end of the <unk> and he took it to the <unk> -- you can actually see a little bit <unk> <unk> and he said, <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
Well, today, for the first time, our environment starts <unk>
And I'm going to show you just a few <unk> <unk> in the idea of able to capture the environment and <unk> something.
Let's start with <unk>
The first project I wanted to share with you is actually one of the first projects.
This was four years and a half years in Italy.
It was a summer with the <unk>
It was the year that eventually won the World <unk>
Maybe some of all, you remember, it was <unk> and France, and at the end of the <unk> <unk> gave the <unk>
And anyway, at the end of the end at the end of the end of the end at the end of the end, the end was Italy.
Now let's see what happened to that day looking at the activity in the network.
Here's the city.
You see the <unk> in the middle and the river <unk>
It's the morning, before the game.
The line of time is in the top.
On the late late afternoon, there are people here and there are doing <unk>
It starts <unk> silence.
<unk> of France.
<unk> people do a quick call and it is going to be <unk>
Second years of the time <unk>
First time a second time.
<unk> and at a moment, the <unk>
<unk> Italy, yeah.
That night they all were going to get up to the center.
There you see the great <unk>
At the next day they were all at the center of the <unk> and the first minister of then.
And then everybody <unk>
You see the image of the place called <unk> <unk> where the age of the <unk> people are going to <unk> is a great party, you can see the <unk> at the end of the day.
This is just an example of how you can measure the pulse of the city of a way that we didn't have been able to do just a few years.
Another example of <unk> is not about people, but of things that we use and we use it.
Today, we know everything about the <unk> of our objects.
This is a map that shows all of the citizens that make a <unk> how it was <unk>
But we know very little about where things are.
So in this project we develop a bunch of small tags to overcome the <unk> in the system for the system.
We started with a few volunteers that helped us in Seattle a little bit more than a year, and we were <unk> different kinds of things, as you can see, things that all of all of the <unk>
And then we put them a little chip, a sheet of <unk> and then we started <unk>
These are the <unk> results.
<unk> <unk>
after a week.
We realized that there are a lot of <unk> in the system.
We can do the same with a lot of energy.
These are data that before it didn't exist.
They're going to happen complicated things and there's a lot of <unk>
But the other thing that we think is that if we see all the days that the cup that the cup that is not in some place in the planet.
You know, if the bottle bottle that is still there, there is still there.
What if you show people, then we can promote some change.
That was the reason of the project.
My colleague of MIT, <unk> <unk> could tell you a lot more about similar and many other things that we can do with that, but I wanted to go to the second part of the beginning, which is <unk> on the environment.
And the first project is something we did a couple of years in <unk>
All started with a question of the city, who came and told us that Spain and the south of Europe have a beautiful tradition of the water use in the architecture.
And the question was, how do technology can technology, the new technology, we send that?
And one of the ideas that we develop in MIT, in a restaurant, I was, imagine that they have a <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
It creates as a <unk> <unk>
If you get the <unk> you can write in them, I'll show them and show them with the <unk>
And the <unk> the <unk> is going to open so that we can change it as you see the picture.
We found this to the mayor of <unk>
I liked a lot of a lot.
And <unk> a <unk> to design the <unk>
We call it <unk>
All the building is made of water.
There are no windows and <unk> but when you're going to be able to be able to be going to happen.
The roof is also covered on water.
And if you have a little bit of wind, if you want to minimize the <unk> the roof.
Or you can close the building and the whole architecture is in this case.
Those days will always be somebody, in the sky when you go on the roof, somebody who was there, and he said, <unk> <unk>
No, it's not that they have <unk> but when it is almost all the whole architecture goes away.
Here is in the way.
You see the people <unk> so it happens in it.
And here's my same trying to not <unk> the sensors that open the water.
I think I should tell you what happened a night when all of the sensors came to work.
That night was actually even more fun.
All the kids of <unk> came to the building because the way we interact in a little bit.
There was not a building that you will go to get to you -- but a building that I had been doing <unk> and holes and you had to jump for them to <unk>
<unk> <unk> And for us that was very interesting because as the architects, engineers, we always think about the use that people will give them our designs.
But then the reality is always <unk>
And that's the beauty of doing things that people use.
This is a picture of the building with the <unk> <unk> the <unk> of water, and <unk>
And this is what led us to think about the next project I'm going to show you.
Imagine that those <unk> could start to get to fly.
Imagine that they could have small <unk> in the air and every one had a small <unk> that changes the color that it changes in space.
This is the video.
Imagine a <unk> like that we saw before, that they move with other in <unk>
We could be able to be this right.
A kind of green screen as this with a normal <unk> in two dimensions.
Or normal but in three dimensions, where it changes is the light, not the <unk>
You can play with a different kind of different way.
Imagine that the screen is going to be able to be able to be able to be able to look at different kinds of worlds.
And then all of that, all of that could a <unk> cloud that you can see it, and <unk> and see from very different <unk>
This is the true <unk> <unk> going down to form a <unk> like before.
When you turn the light, you see this. The same thing we saw before.
Imagine each one of them with a person.
We can have every <unk> with a entrance that comes from people from people, and so on.
I want to show you something for the first time.
We've been working with <unk> <unk> <unk> of the best dancers of today, the star of the <unk> from the star of the <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> to capture their movements on 3D and use it as <unk>
So here we can see <unk>
On the left you see the <unk> <unk> in different <unk>
It's so much a 3D piece in real time.
It can <unk> all the movement.
You can go all the way.
And once we have the <unk> we can play with them, with the color and the movement, with <unk> and <unk>
We want to use this as a possible <unk>
I wanted to show you the last project in which we're working on.
It's something for the <unk> of London.
It's called <unk>
And the idea is, imagine another time, that we could bring people to do something and change our <unk> environment as a <unk> <unk> like <unk> <unk> but with a cloud.
Imagine that we could make all <unk> a little bit for a <unk>
And I think what the remarkable thing that has happened in the last few years that in the last two decades, we spent the physical world in the physical world to the digital world.
We've explored everything like knowledge, and it's accessible through the Internet.
Today, for the first time -- and the campaign campaign would be <unk> we can happen the digital world of the <unk> power of networks, the physical world.
In our case, this can we wanted to use to design and make a <unk>
That means something built in a city.
But morning can be to take the challenges challenges think about climate change or carbon emissions how do we move from the digital world.
The idea is that we can make people that we can make people to do this together, in order to be able to do this together, in a collective way.
The cloud is a cloud, again, in the same way that the real cloud is a cloud of particles.
And those particles are water, whereas in our cloud are <unk>
It's a physical structure in London, but it covered the <unk>
You can move up in where you have different experiences.
It can be able to be able to share the main moments of the <unk> <unk> and even more, and it can be used as a form of connection with the community.
So it's so much a physical cloud of the sky as something that you can go up as a new <unk>
You can get there there.
And as if it was a new <unk> <unk> in night, but the most important thing is that being a new experience for anyone who will go to the top.
Thank you.
Would you like to be better than they do it.
So imagine that I told you that, with only a lot of changes in their genes, they could improve the <unk> by a more <unk> more <unk>
Or maybe you would like to be in the best way, to be more smart to have more <unk>
Would you like to be more attractive and sure of the <unk>
What would you live more with good technology.
Or maybe they're about those people who always wanted to be more creative.
What is what more <unk>
What would you say, if you could choose anything?
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
How many people get <unk>
Raise your hand. Let me see.
<unk> you probably have to have the amount of creative people.
That's very good.
How many <unk> <unk>
A few more.
And the <unk>
A little bit.
What about the <unk>
Ah, most of it makes me feel very good as a doctor.
If you could have something of this the world would be very different.
It's just <unk>
Or maybe it's possible?
The evolution has been a <unk> subject here in the TED TED -- but today, I want to give you a sign of a doctor on the issue.
The great <unk> of the 20th century, <unk> <unk> that also <unk> in the <unk> <unk> wrote a clinical trial in biology has a sense of <unk>
But if you see, the biological evolution consider this: it's just the past, or the future?
It's about the other or us?
This is another look at the tree of life.
The human part of this <unk> well in a end is, of course, the most of us.
<unk> of a common <unk> with sexual chimpanzees about six or eight million years.
In the year there has been about 20  25 species of <unk>
Some of them have gone and <unk>
We have been here about <unk> years.
I could look like that we're very far from other parts of this tree of life, but actually, in the most the basic power of our cells is more or less the same.
You realize that we can be able to control and control the power of a common bacteria to produce the energy of an common bacteria that is used to try the <unk>
This is not like insulin insulin but it is the same <unk> <unk> of the <unk>
And talking about bacteria -- you realize that we all have in the most bacteria that the cells that we have in the rest of the <unk>
Maybe 10 times more.
I mean, you think about it, when I would just get it <unk> it brings them out of the <unk> you think about the <unk>
<unk> is a reasonable environment for those projects.
It's <unk> <unk> it's very <unk>
And we're going to provide all the imagination that they can want to want no effort to want to have no effort to want to have no effort to want to have no effort to want to have no effort to want to have no effort to want to have no effort to want to have no effort to want to have no effort to want to have no effort
It's really like a quick way to bacteria with the bacteria with the <unk> <unk> to the <unk>
But by the other, we are a wonderful environment for those bacteria in the same way that they are essential for our life.
They are going to make them <unk> <unk> and they will protect us for certain disease.
But what do we make the future?
We are in a kind of evolutionary balance as a species?
Or it will be going to become something different, something maybe better adapted to the <unk>
In this incredible symphony of the universe, life on Earth is like a brief <unk> the animal animal as a only and only <unk> and human life and human life, a little bit.
That was us.
And it also was the <unk> part of this talk so I hope that you have <unk>
When I just <unk> my college had my first kind of biology.
I was fascinated by <unk> and beauty of biology.
I fell in the power of evolution and I realized something fundamental in most of the existence of life, in the living organisms every single cell is just <unk> and all the genetic energy of that cell cell goes on the two cells.
But when you look at the organisms -- the things start to change.
He leaves it in a sex cycle.
And something really important with the emergence of the sexual reproduction that happens the genome the rest of the body gets <unk>
In fact, you might say that the <unk> of the death of the body is going to focus in the same time of sexual foods.
I have to <unk> that when I was a graduate student who was thinking, well, <unk> <unk> death for <unk> seemed pretty reasonable at that time, but with every year that I was used every time I had more <unk>
I was going to understand the feelings of George <unk> that still <unk> in the <unk> <unk> in their 90 years.
And one night somebody took up to her home.
He opens the door.
It is a kind of kind of kind of <unk> <unk> <unk>
It looks look at it, and he says, <unk> in looking for a <unk> <unk>
It says, <unk> says, "I need the <unk>
I realized it as a doctor who was working by a different goal of the <unk> not necessarily <unk> just different.
I was trying to preserve the body.
I wanted to be <unk>
I wanted to bring health in the disease.
And I wanted to live more and more <unk>
The evolution is going to happen the genome to the next <unk> <unk> and <unk> generation after generation.
From a real view of view, you are like <unk> rockets designed to send the genetics to the next level of the next level, and then we have to fall into the sea.
I think that all of the <unk> the feeling that I put <unk> <unk> when he said, "I don't want to get the <unk> through my work.
I want to <unk> not <unk>
The evolution is not necessarily the <unk>
It's not necessarily the most big or the more fast or the more fast and not even the more smart
The evolution is going to be able to get the better creatures to their environment.
That's the only test of survival and success.
In the bottom of the ocean the bacteria <unk> that you can survive the heat of the <unk> that <unk> if they had fish there, fish <unk> to the <unk> yet they have gotten to make that a <unk> environment.
So what does this mean when we look at what's happening in evolution and if we go back to think about the place of humans in religion and in particular, if we look at it to the phase <unk> I would say there's a lot of possibilities.
The first thing is that we don't <unk>
We've reached a kind of balance.
And the <unk> would be that through medicine in the first place, we've learned to preserve a lot of genes that in the other way they would have been <unk> and <unk> of the population.
And in second of all, as species, we have <unk> our environment for us to make us so as we get to it.
And by the way, by the way, <unk> <unk> and <unk> so much that it's not possible to have the <unk> necessary for evolution.
A second possibility is that you can make a evolution of the natural kind of natural class by the forces of nature.
And the argument here we need to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be <unk> but they're <unk>
And in the <unk> when as a kind of <unk> planets are going to be <unk> and the dynamic changes that can produce the evolution of the natural way.
But there are a third thing, a very third possibility -- and <unk>
I call it <unk> the new evolution, which is not just <unk> but <unk> and <unk> for us as individuals in the decisions that they <unk>
Now, how could it happen this?
How could we get to do that?
First of all, the reality that a lot of people today, in some cultures today, in a few cultures are taking decisions about their own.
In a few cultures are teaching to have more mammals than women.
It's not something really good for society but it's what it takes the individual and family and family.
Think that if it would be possible to be able to choose not only sex of their <unk> but in their own body to make the genetic <unk> to cure or prevent disease.
And if we could make the genetic changes to take it into the <unk> or the <unk> or to reduce the risk of cancer.
They don't want to do those changes in their <unk>
If you look at the future that kind of changes is going to be increasingly possible.
The African <unk> <unk> started in 1990, and seven, 13 years.
<unk> <unk> million dollars.
At the next year, in 2004, I could be the same work for 20 million dollars in three -- four months.
Today, you can get a full sequence of the 3,000 million pairs of the human genome in a cost of a cost to a cost to a cost of <unk> and in a week.
It's not just a lot for a lot of a lot of human genome and being more more than the <unk> of all.
They come on those changes.
The same technology that has produced the human insulin in bacteria can make virus that we're not just going to protect them in the same of them but they are going to be <unk> against other virus.
<unk> or there is no clinical trial in the course with the vaccine against the <unk> <unk> in the cells of a <unk>
You can imagine something good than the <unk>
That's reality today and the future is going to be increasingly possible.
Imagine then only other two little <unk>
You can change the cells of their bodies but if you could change the cells of their <unk>
And if you could change the sperm and the <unk> or the <unk> or changing the <unk> <unk> and give their children a better chance of a more healthy life of a more healthy life, you know, <unk> to reduce the risk of cancer?
Who don't want children more <unk>
And then, that same technology goes up that the same engine of the science that can produce the changes to prevent diseases will allow us to allow us to allow us to get <unk> <unk> a better memory.
Why don't have the <unk> of an Ken park about everything if you could <unk> with the next generation of the <unk>
Why don't have a <unk> muscle muscle that allowed us to run faster and more <unk>
Why don't we live over time.
This is going to be <unk>
And when we are in conditions about the next generation and we can take the attributes that we wanted to have become the evolution of before the <unk>
We're going to take a process that they usually could take 100 thousand years and we can take them to 1,000 years and maybe within the next hundred years.
These are choices that their grandchildren, or the grandchildren of their grandchildren, are going to have to them.
We're going to use these choices in <unk> of a better society, more <unk>
Or we're going to choose to pick out different <unk> different attributes that we want for some of us but not for a few of us but not for the <unk>
We're going to build a society that is more boring and more <unk> and more <unk>
This is the kind of question that we're going to have to see.
And the most profound thing that we're going to be able to develop the wisdom and the wisdom we need to take these decisions <unk>
To be good or enough to bad and before what it might be <unk> these choices are going to depend on us.
Thank you.
Imagine a big explosion when you're going to 900 <unk> <unk>
Imagine a plane full of smoke.
Imagine a engine doing <unk> <unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
Well, I had a day that day I was sitting in the <unk>
It was the only thing that I could talk about the <unk>
So I looked at the looked at the looked -- and they said, "It's no problem.
The pilot had <unk> the plane, and we were not so far.
I could see <unk>
Two minutes later, three things happened at the same time.
The pilot <unk> the plane with the <unk>
It's not the same.
<unk> <unk>
Imagine being in a plane and without <unk>
And then he said three words ...
The three other words that I have heard.
He said, <unk> for the <unk>
I didn't have to talk about the <unk>
I was able to see it in your eyes,
It was <unk> <unk>
I want to share with you three things that I learned about myself that day.
I learned that everything changes in a second.
We have this list of things to do before we were in life, these things that we want to do in life, and I thought about all people who wanted to get and I didn't did all the people who I wanted to get out and did all the experiences that I've wanted to have and never <unk>
As I thought about that, I was going to be a sentence, which is <unk> <unk> <unk>
Because if the guy is ready and the person is there, I'm going to be able to be able to be able to be able to be.
I don't want to <unk> nothing in life.
And that <unk> that is really changed my life.
The second thing that I learned that day -- and this is as <unk> the bridge George George who was not for a lot of -- I thought about a lot of <unk>
I've lived a good life.
In my humanity and with my mistakes I've been trying to improve everything I did.
But in my humanity I also realized my <unk>
And I don't know the time that we <unk> in things that are not aware of people who do matter.
And I thought about my wife, with my wife, with the people.
And later, like <unk> in that, I decided to take the energy energy of my life.
It's not hard, but it's much better.
In two years I haven't had a fight with my wife.
It feels like <unk>
I don't try to have <unk> <unk> being <unk>
The third thing I learned -- and this is like your mental clock is <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
You see the water <unk>
I'm saying, "Why?" <unk>
I don't want this for 20 pieces like you see in those <unk>
And as I <unk> I had a sense of <unk> <unk> not a fear.
It's almost like we've been <unk> for that all our life.
But it was very possible.
I didn't want to <unk> I love my life.
And that <unk> <unk> in a single thought, which is just a thing.
I wish I could see my children grow.
A month later, I was in a performance of my daughter -- first grade, not a lot of discovery -- <unk> <unk>  And I mean, <unk> as a small child.
And for me, that was all the reason of being the world.
In that point I believe, to connect those two points, that the only thing that matters in my life is a great father.
All of all, the only goal I have in life is being a good father.
I took me a <unk> of not dying that day.
And I took me another gift that was the possibility of looking at the future and go back and live from another way.
You are flying today, the challenge to imagine that you can imagine that the same thing is going on your plane -- and why you don't be -- but you can imagine and how to <unk>
What is what they <unk> that they still expect to do because they think you're going to live by <unk>
How do you change their relationships and energy energy, in you.
And the most importantly, they're being the best parents that <unk>
Thank you.
Clearly I've been <unk> in life with many projects.
But the most great thing that I worked was for this guy.
The guy is called <unk>
<unk> was one of the most important <unk> of the <unk>
A day came to his house after run and said, "Dad, I feel a <unk> in the <unk>
And that was the beginning of vaccines.
Today, you have a <unk>
It can only use your eyes.
Their work in me.
I have a design of design and animation so that, obviously, the <unk> is something that we are, and <unk> in the world of art.
So we decided that we were going to <unk> <unk> <unk> and your cause.
So I went to me with his brother and his father and I said, "Let's give you this money.
What's going to do with <unk>
And his brother said, "I want to be able to talk about Tony again.
I just want to be able to communicate with him and he would be able to communicate it.
And I said, "A second, it's not that <unk> <unk> <unk> is not that all people with <unk> can communicate through those <unk>
And he said, "No, unless you be important somebody and you have a very good place, you can't actually do it.
These devices are not food for the people."
And I said, "Well, how do you communicate <unk>
Someone to seen the film "The <unk> and <unk>
They communicate with that way, they go to the finger.
I said, "This is <unk> How can you be able to be?
So I showed me with the only desire to give me a <unk> and instead of that, I took a sign that I didn't have the least idea of how to <unk>
I took me with his brother and with his father there in that right time, well, this is the <unk> Tony is going to build a machine, and we're going to find a way to make their art again.
Because it's thrilled that somebody who have so much in its inside you can't <unk>
So I talked about a couple of months later.
I met these guys called <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> who have a technology that lets you have a technology in any surface and then, with a <unk> <unk> and then, with a <unk> <unk>
So you're going to make the art of art like this.
All things that <unk> they say, they're part of a cycle of life.
First of you start with the <unk> organs then with the bad words, after the <unk> and the end, people start to do art.
But there was always a cycle of life in their <unk>
And so he started the journey.
And about two years later, about a year later, about a year later, then a lot of organization and a lot of organization and a lot of organization and a lot of the things of one side of a side of the other we had gotten a couple of things.
One, you go to the doors of the <unk> companies and we get a machine to be able to <unk> a machine like the <unk> <unk>
Which was great.
And actually, it's the more <unk> I call it <unk> because I talk with the guy with the one of the guy you get a email of it, and you say, "I don't have the <unk> This guy is <unk>
The other thing that we did was to bring up seven programmers around the whole world of all the <unk> of all the <unk> of the <unk> to our house.
My wife, children and I, we moved up to the <unk> and these hackers and programmers and <unk> and <unk> they took the control of the house.
A lot of our friends thought we thought we would do something completely stupid and that when you <unk> they would have taken the face of the walls and in the place it would be <unk>
But for two weeks ago we were going to get up to the <unk> of <unk> my son was part of my dog -- and we create it.
It's called <unk> <unk> and you can see the <unk>
They are a couple of <unk> sun that we buy in the <unk> of <unk> <unk> something of <unk> and things from <unk> and <unk> <unk>
We take a <unk> camera -- the <unk> of a <unk> light -- and now there is a device that is free -- we published the code that is free -- we published the code <unk> the software <unk>
And we create a device that has no limitation at all.
There is no company that I say <unk>
There is no hospital that I can say <unk>
Any person with design today has access to draw and communicate using only your eyes.
Thank you.
Thank you so much.
So at the end of the two weeks we went to the room of <unk>
I love this picture because this is the room of another person and that's his room.
There was all this <unk> and <unk> for the great <unk>
And then after a year of <unk> two weeks ago when the entire night, Tony came to draw for the first time in seven years.
And this is a wonderful picture because this is the <unk> system of their life and it's looking through the <unk> system.
We choose the bed to see.
And we put a slide on a wall of the wall of the hospital.
And he came to draw for the first time in front of his family and friends -- and you can imagine what it was the feeling in the <unk>
And the fun was that we had to test in the wall so that we feel like we were able to take it <unk> as well.
At the end of this one, he sent us an email email and this was what we said, "This was the first time that I took in seven years.
I felt like if I had been under the water and somebody finally come back to <unk> and let me take me out there so that I could <unk>
It's not <unk>
In some way that is our <unk> of war.
That's what it keeps in movement, <unk>
And we have a long way to move with this.
It's a great device but it's the equivalent of a <unk>
Someone with this particular potential deserves much more.
So we're trying to figure out how to figure out how to be able to figure out how to <unk> and we do it more fast and <unk>
Since then we've had all kinds of recognition.
We've got a lot of <unk>
Remember, it's <unk> none of us is doing money with this.
Everything comes from our own eye.
<unk> were <unk> "Oh, this is <unk>
Mary <unk> something about us and then, in 1990, the magazine gave us as one of the 50 50 <unk> and it was really cool.
The best thing about this -- and this is what it comes from close to the <unk> is that in 2012, of this year in the <unk> of the <unk> in the center of Los Angeles is going to have a exhibition called <unk> in the <unk>
And <unk> in the <unk> is going to have the best <unk> of the urban art of <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> all they are going to be there.
<unk> is going to be in the show which is pretty impressive.
So basically this is my idea, if you see something that it's not possible as possible.
None of what there is in this room was possible -- I mean, the computer, the <unk> <unk> nothing was possible in a certain time.
It would be <unk> anything of this room.
I'm not <unk> I never did anything with technology <unk> <unk> I just did something and <unk> with people to be able to make it happen.
And these are the questions that I want all we all do all the days when we can find something that you can be able to do.
Thank you.
I've spent the last few years <unk> in situations particularly hard and at the same time.
I went to the <unk>
I worked in a <unk> <unk> <unk>
<unk> in <unk> <unk> hard and dangerous.
And I spent 30 days eating just this very fun of the beginning, something hard in the middle of a very dangerous <unk>
In fact, in a great part of my career I've been <unk> in situations with the only goal, of the only goal of <unk> social issues that are <unk> -- and with lucky, <unk> of a way you can see <unk> and <unk> for the audience.
So when I knew that I was going to make a talk about the world of the <unk> and <unk> I wanted to do something a little bit about a little different thing.
So some of you can have <unk> or no, a couple of weeks ago, I took a <unk> in <unk>
I took some messages on Facebook, some of me in Facebook, and some of the <unk> rights.
What there was what I was this: <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> my TEDTalk that they don't have idea of what is and with content could be <unk> in your face, especially if I put them on <unk> to you or the company to do it.
But I said this, it's a very good opportunity to be <unk>
Do you know how many people look at these <unk>
<unk>
It's a title in the way.
So even with that <unk> I knew somebody was going to buy the rights rights.
If I would have asked me a year there was no year that I had been able to get <unk>
But in the new film that I'm working on, we looked at the world of the <unk> <unk>
And as I said before I said before, I have been in situations in the last few years but nothing could be <unk> nothing could be <unk> for something as hard or so dangerous as to go into the <unk>
You see, I had this idea for a film.
Morgan <unk> I want to do a film that I try to do a film that <unk> <unk> and <unk> and that all the film was <unk> with <unk> and <unk>
The film is going to call "The greatest movie never <unk>
What happens in the greatest movie would be <unk> is that all of the right-hand side of the beginning of the <unk> has images from <unk> all the time from the <unk> which is before the <unk> the <unk>
Now this <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
These people are <unk> to the film to <unk> forever.
And so the film happened? All this idea. <unk> <unk> is what? It's <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
I'm a <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> it was more <unk>
It was <unk> <unk>
But we're not just going to have the <unk> <unk> in the title of the title but we're going to make sure about <unk> all the way that we can in the <unk>
You may take a <unk> and it turns out the most great thing that you have <unk>
The most great car that you have <unk> in the biggest movie I would have <unk> the best <unk> that you have <unk> <unk> from the greatest film never <unk>
<unk> <unk> <unk> the idea is then to show you the <unk> as part of the life, so that <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> -- and we actually show the whole process of how it works.
The goal of the <unk> is <unk>
You're going to see all the process in this film.
That's the whole idea of the beginning of beginning to end.
And I would love to help me help you do happen.
Robert <unk> You know, it's fun because it's the first time I hear it, it's the <unk> of the audience.
<unk> However, I don't know how <unk> is going to be people to it.
<unk> you have a <unk> I don't know if <unk> is very <unk> but you know how to <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> How much money you need to do that?
MS: A million and a half, <unk> <unk> John <unk> I think it's going to be hard to be hard to be hard to be hard to convince them to a couple of big <unk>
<unk> <unk> you know, perhaps for the moment that you can see the film we will see it as a bunch of <unk> <unk>
MS: What do you think it's going to be <unk>
<unk> <unk> Most of the answers will be <unk>
MS: But it's going to be hard to <unk> by the film or for being it.
JK: <unk> things.
MS: This means you're not very optimistic.
So I <unk> I need help.
MK: I can help.
MS: Very good <unk>
MK: We have to think about what they can.
MS: Yeah. That is the <unk> when you look at people to get <unk>
MK: We have some places where they go. <unk> <unk> <unk>
MS: I thought you <unk> the <unk> meant we have a conversation outside of gravity.
<unk> the camera means we don't want to know anything.
MS: And so it was, one of all, all of these companies suddenly disappeared.
Nobody wanted to have nothing to see with this film.
I loved me.
They didn't want to know nothing with this project.
And he turned out very <unk> I thought that the concept of compassion was <unk> the product to so much people as possible, so many people can look like it as possible.
<unk> in the world today this intersection of new media and old media and the stage of the <unk> media is not the idea to tell it with that new vehicle <unk>
No, that was what I was born.
But the problem was, you see, my idea was <unk> and that mistake was this.
Actually, it wasn't not a mistake.
There was no mistake at all.
This would be okay.
But the problem was what it represents this image.
See, when you look for images of <unk> in Google <unk>     This is one of the first images that was <unk>
I like your <unk> <unk> <unk> No.
This was the problem: the <unk> of simulation or <unk> <unk> or <unk> <unk> or <unk> <unk> which is <unk> by the <unk> or we get out of information, especially the last line of <unk> being the last line.
You see, we hear a lot about cows in these days.
Our politicians <unk> the president <unk> the <unk> the <unk>
But suddenly when it comes to make it really something it changes it.
But why? Well, cows gives it <unk>   like that <unk> camera, that still still still have <unk>
It's <unk>                         
And it's also very similar.
What's another thing is <unk>
<unk> a whole lot of <unk> <unk>
That is very <unk>
When I started talking about the companies and tell you that we wanted to tell this story and said, "No, we want to be <unk> <unk> story.
We want to take it a story, but that <unk> <unk>
See, when I was a child, and my father was going to get me in some of me -- and there is he going to look like it as a used to be <unk>  <unk> there are three sides in every story.
It's your story, it's my story, and it's the story.
As you see, in this film we wanted to tell the real story.
But with only one company, a <unk> <unk> -- and that only because I knew that I knew John Bond and Richard <unk> of a lot of years ago, I realized that I would have to go on my own, and I would have to take them to the <unk>
So what I started <unk> to suddenly -- so I started to give you <unk> is that when you start to talk about companies the idea of understanding your brand is a universal problem.
MS: I have friends who make films very huge films and others who make films small films like mine.
And my friends who make films of Hollywood Hollywood say that the reason that the reason that their films have so successful it must be so successful it is that they have.
And then my friends who make green films say, "Well, how they're supposed to be going to compete with these big <unk> movies of <unk>
And the film is called the greatest movie never <unk>
How are we going to see specifically to <unk> in <unk>
Every time I'm going to come up and every time I got my <unk> you'll see the <unk> <unk>
In any time for a interview with somebody can say, "It's good for this <unk>
You're <unk> you see a little bit.
I want to help you <unk>
Maybe you should get a little bit of this before the <unk>
And there are one of these <unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk> as <unk> <unk> are going to have their opportunity.
We're going to have so much for me as a little bit like <unk> <unk> in <unk> as it is.
That's the look at general.
Now I can answer their questions and give you a look at it.
<unk> <unk> We are a small.
<unk> the most small films that <unk> are more good <unk>
So we don't have the budget that they have other <unk>
So do you do things like that, you know, <unk> people are the reason that we can imagine.
MS: What would they use to describe <unk>
<unk> is in <unk>
<unk> That's a great question.
Woman: <unk>
MS: <unk> is not the way you want to describe something that you put on the <unk>
Man: We talked about something <unk>
I think that <unk> is a great word that you really put this <unk> in the <unk> and <unk>
It takes you a lot.
How do you make a little bit more time with the best <unk> <unk> three times more <unk>
Things like those who <unk> the <unk>
MS: And that's a <unk> company.
What are you about me? What is the kind of <unk>
I need to talk to the man of the street, to the people like me, to <unk>
They have to talk about my <unk>
MS: How do you define your <unk>
Man: <unk> my <unk>
I don't know.
I like your mom.
Woman: <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> less than <unk>
MS: All right, what is the <unk>
<unk> Something <unk> <unk> Man: I guess the kind of individual, the way I have would be like a <unk> <unk>
I like a lot of colors -- a lot of <unk> and things like that.
They usually have <unk> as a sun, or I like <unk> and <unk>
Woman: If Dan was a brand of a brand could be a <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
Man 2: The brand I am, <unk> <unk> <unk>
<unk> 2: In part of the <unk> in part of <unk> <unk> I don't know.
Man Yes! I'm the kind of <unk>
And you have to give them to <unk> in the country and in the world.
So I guess that's my <unk>
In my small <unk> that's my <unk>
Man 2: My brand is <unk> because they <unk> the <unk>
Man <unk> <unk> <unk>
It's that something?
<unk> I'm <unk>
<unk> I'm <unk>
MS: Well, we're not all of us to be <unk> <unk> but they often put me in the intersection of <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk>
I realized that I needed a <unk>
I needed somebody who could go on my head, somebody who could help help me understand what the <unk> <unk>
And I found a company called <unk> <unk>
They helped companies like <unk> <unk> <unk> to discover that personality.
If you could do it for them, you could probably do it for me.
<unk> <unk> the pictures, right?
MS: Yeah. The first picture is a small picture.
<unk> <unk> a little bit how you need with your thoughts and feelings your way to be.
MS: These people can see my way to see the world.
<unk> <unk> from that world.
MS: That world? I think your world is the world in which <unk> as the people who do us, your friends, your friends, the way you live your life, the work that you do.
All of those things, and they start in a place and in my case, and you start in my case in my case in the West Virginia.
<unk> What's the next thing you want to talk about.
MS: The next is this is the best day of my life."
<unk> How do you need this with your feelings and your feelings of it be?
MS: It's like who would like to be me.
I like the different things.
I like things like the easy things, I like the easy things.
<unk> <unk> of the <unk> so what do you do that?
What is the <unk> where it comes from <unk> you find it.
Why is important <unk> What is the <unk>
Tell me a little bit about it.
A little bit more than you, which is not who you are.
What other other <unk>
It has to have to be <unk> where kind of <unk>
MS: <unk> Thank you. No, thank you.
<unk> Thank you for your <unk> <unk> <unk> Yeah.
MS: Yeah, I don't know what you're going to get out of this.
There was a lot of <unk> in all this.
<unk> <unk> the first thing that I saw was this idea that there are two different sides but <unk> in your <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> is a <unk>
They were very good together.
And I think there's almost a paradox in them.
And I think that some companies are only <unk> in one of your strong dots or in the other instead of <unk> in the other instead of <unk>
A lot of companies tend to be the nature <unk> to avoid the things that they are not going to be <unk> people who are not going to be <unk> and you can help them get something positive for you, and it's nice to see it.
What other <unk> are that?
The first here is the <unk>
And you can see this <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk>
Now there are <unk> <unk> and <unk> those things that have gone and come up and this <unk> is something pretty powerful.
MS:
If somebody would tell you that you <unk> your identity of <unk> your <unk> <unk>
You're a <unk> <unk> you're somebody who makes the blood <unk>
Or you're more good <unk>
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
The attributes of <unk> are how to be <unk> as the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> or <unk> as <unk> <unk> <unk> or <unk> <unk> or <unk> like <unk>
Or you're more <unk> <unk>
You're aware of <unk> as <unk>
You are <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
You are a lot of a lot of <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> or <unk> as the Dalai Lama or <unk>
In the course of this film we had to over 500 companies, <unk> and <unk> who said, <unk> didn't want to be part of this project.
They didn't want to have nothing to see with this film, mostly because they could not be control, they could not be control on the end.
We allowed us to tell you the story of the <unk> and we have to tell the story in this film of how they now use the <unk> <unk> to identify the centers of the future in the brain as a <unk>
We went to San <unk> where they have <unk> the goods to the <unk>
In all the city for the last five years there are no <unk> there is no <unk> there's no <unk>
And we went to international grandchildren where companies are able to be able to get into the schools with the <unk> problems in America.
The amazing thing for me is that the projects that I have had the biggest answer or where I've had more success are those in the ones that I've been able to do with things with things with.
And that's what they did these <unk>
<unk> <unk>
I'm going to try you directly with the artist.
I'm going to work with him to create something different, something that is going to do thinking about people, which is going to challenge the way we look at the world.
And how do you say, they had <unk>
Well, since the film was sent to the <unk> <unk> let's take a look.
According to <unk> the film was sent to <unk> and since then this is not <unk> we've had a hundred million view, in the media.
This is just a period of two weeks and a half.
That's just in <unk> and I didn't get TV.
The film is still <unk>
It's still not in <unk>
It's not even taken in other countries.
In the end of the end, this film has been started to win <unk>
And it's not bad because almost all the parts that we talked about <unk> to their clients will not be true.
And I've always believed that if you take risks, that in those risks that in those risks are opportunity.
I think when you give people that the people of that is going to be <unk>
I think that when you put their employees in the loss of the loss of the loss is preparing all their company for <unk>
I feel what it has to be going to be going to be able to encourage people to <unk>
We have to encourage people who don't have fear of the opportunities that they can <unk>
In the end, we go back to the end, I think we have to give you a place to fear.
We have to put that camera, in a <unk>
<unk> <unk> <unk> risk.
From a <unk> to the time, we have to raise the risk.
And in the way, we have to get the <unk>
Today, more than never a little bit of honesty is going to run a long way.
And I said this, with honesty and transparency, my whole talk -- the <unk> has been taken by my good friends of <unk> who <unk> who were <unk> the rights rights in <unk>
<unk> <unk> big data in big opportunities for companies around the world.
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
Many people.
June Cohen: So, <unk> in the name of transparency, which happened exactly with those <unk>
MS: It's a wonderful question.
In my pocket I have a quote to the name of the TED organization -- the <unk> <unk> a <unk> <unk> to be <unk> to be <unk> to me to be <unk>
The idea behind the <unk> <unk> is really simple.
We don't want to take Iran to be able to take the nuclear distribution.
Your active to develop nuclear weapons is the plant of <unk> in <unk>
The gray boxes that you see are a matter of control in real time.
If we do all of these systems that control <unk> and <unk> we can cause a lot of problems with the <unk>
<unk> boxes not use software software <unk> are a completely different technology.
But if we have to put a effective virus in the <unk> in a computer computer used by a engineer, to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to go.
This is the plan behind <unk>
We started with a <unk>
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and the nuclear program is <unk> <unk> mission.
It's easy, right?
I want to tell you how we found this.
When we started to investigate about <unk> about six months, the purpose was completely <unk>
The only thing that I knew is that it's very, very complex in the part of <unk> the <unk> used multiple <unk> <unk>
It seemed to want to do something with these boxes -- you know, these care systems.
And that we call us the attention, and we started a experiment where our environment in <unk> and we saw what happened to this.
And so they were very simple.
<unk> <unk> as a number of lab that I don't liked our <unk> the <unk> but I didn't want to eat.
I didn't have sense for me.
And then I experience with different scenarios of <unk> I realized and I thought, "This is a <unk>
It's completely <unk>
The <unk> is looking for <unk> in the red box if you find a certain <unk> and even if the program that is trying to talk about <unk> is actually working on that word.
If no, <unk> no anything.
So that I called my attention, and we started working on this almost 24 hours at the day, because <unk> we don't know what the <unk>
I could be, let's say about example, a plant of the United States or a chemical plant in Germany.
<unk> that <unk> the goal soon.
So we moved up and <unk> the code, and we found that I was <unk> in two <unk> <unk> a small and a big.
They also saw that they were very excited about people who obviously had all the whole information of the enemy.
<unk> all of the points that we die.
You probably even know how much <unk> the <unk>
So you know it.
And if you've heard that the <unk> <unk> is complex and high technology, let me say, the <unk> is very complex <unk>
It's very above everything we've been seen before.
So here you see a sample of this code of <unk>
We are talking about 15 percent of the code.
It seems like the old language.
I want to tell you how we could find sense to this code.
What we were looking at the beginning were called the landscape of the system, because we know what they do.
Then we were looking at <unk> and structures of data and we try to <unk> with the real world with perfect world in the real world.
We need theories about <unk> that we can go or <unk>
To be going to get to theories about <unk> <unk> which is definitely a <unk> <unk> it must be a white <unk> and it's probably sitting in Iran, because it's where most of the infections has been <unk>
They don't find several thousands of goals in that area.
It basically comes to the plant of nuclear energy, and the plant of <unk>
So I told my <unk> <unk> a list of all of the experts in <unk> and plants between our <unk>
I call them and I found them in a effort for <unk> their experience with what we found in code and data.
And worked pretty well.
So we could put the small <unk> <unk> with the control of the <unk>
<unk> is that part of the <unk> that black object, you see.
If you take the speed of this <unk> certainly can be <unk> and even make the <unk> <unk>
What we also saw is that the goal of the heart of the heart of the <unk> and you see, in a obvious effort to come back to the engineers of <unk> so they couldn't solve this quickly.
We tried to figure out the big digital <unk> looking at very close to the data and their structures.
So for example, the number of <unk> <unk> in that code, you can't be <unk>
I started doing scientific literature about how these <unk> are built in <unk> and found that they're <unk> in what it's called a <unk> and every <unk> has <unk>
That was a sense, there was a coincidence.
And they put it better yet.
These <unk> in Iran are <unk> in 15 parts called <unk>
And guess what we found in the code of <unk>
One structure almost <unk>
So again, that was a good coincidence.
This makes us a lot of confidence in understanding what we had to each hands.
And so that there is not like this.
So the results have been about after several weeks old.
<unk> <unk> in <unk> without <unk> and we had to go back to this.
Even so we found that both both the digital <unk> we were going to a single single and same goal, but from different <unk>
The small <unk> is taking a <unk> and doing the <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and the big <unk> is <unk> with six <unk> and <unk>
In <unk> we're very excited that we have a lot of what the <unk>
It's <unk> and it's just <unk>
We don't need to worry that other goals are <unk> by <unk>
So here I show you some very interesting things that we saw my <unk>
There is the <unk> box and you see the <unk>
What this thing makes it is <unk> the values of sensors for instance, of the sensors of pressure and the sensors of <unk> and the sensors is still <unk> which is still going to be <unk>
And believe that or not, these data data is <unk> by <unk>
It's like in the Hollywood movies where for the <unk> the <unk> <unk>
It's great <unk>
The idea here is obviously not only <unk> to the <unk> in the <unk>
It's really much more dangerous and <unk>
The idea is <unk> a digital system.
We need the digital systems where a human land could not act fast.
For example, in a plant of energy, when the great <unk> of water goes on the speed of the ground, you need to open <unk> <unk>
Obviously this can't make it a human same.
There is where we need systems of digital <unk>
And when they're <unk> then you can see things bad.
The plant can be.
And not the <unk> and not the <unk> system.
And so I am.
But it can be worse.
What I'm going to say is very important.
Think about this. This is <unk>
It has nothing to see, specifically, <unk> <unk> <unk>
I could work also, for example, for example, in a plant of energy, or in a <unk>
It's <unk>
And you don't have a <unk> <unk> that we put this <unk> with a <unk> <unk> as we saw in the case of <unk>
You can also use the conventional technology in <unk>
<unk> as possible.
And if you take that, with what <unk> is with a <unk> <unk>
That's the consequence we need to see.
Unfortunately, the biggest number of goals for such <unk> is not in the Middle East.
It's in the United States and in Japan.
All the green areas are spaces with a lot of goals.
We need to face the <unk> and the best we start going to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to
Thank you.
Chris Anderson: I have a question.
<unk> has done public in many sides that people think that the <unk> is the main entity behind this.
What's your <unk>
Ralph <unk> well, you really want to hear this?
Yeah. <unk>
My opinion is that the <unk> is <unk> but the engine is not <unk>
The engine behind this is <unk>
There is a <unk> and that's the United States, luckily, <unk>
Because of another way, our problems would be even larger.
CA: Thank you for <unk> Thank you <unk>
I want you to imagine a robot that can be able to take and that they gave them <unk> or other who make users of <unk> <unk> and come back to walk.
In <unk> <unk> we call these robots, <unk>
There are nothing different than something that you put in the morning, and it gives you a big power that is also going to take their speed, and ask them for example, to drive the balance.
It's actually the real integration of the man and the machine.
But not just that -- you can integrate and <unk> with the universe.
This is not a <unk> idea.
So to show you now what we're working on what we're working by talking about the American soldier that in average, must take on her back a <unk> of 45 pounds, and it's <unk> to take even more team.
Obviously, this leads to some important <unk> -- <unk> in the morning, in the 30 percent of the soldiers -- with <unk> <unk>
We decided to look at this challenge and create a fortune that could help support the thing.
Let me introduce you to the <unk> -- or <unk> <unk> <unk>
Let's go back with the <unk> <unk> I can give it 90 kilos for a lot of hours.
Your design is allowed to get in <unk> <unk> and <unk> movements with great <unk>
<unk> what I want to do, or where I want to go, and then you get my force and my <unk>
<unk> <unk> We are ready, with our <unk> <unk> to produce this <unk> this new <unk> this year.
I mean, it's a reality.
So let's go back to the <unk> users of <unk> about what I feel particularly creative.
There are <unk> millions of people that are <unk> in the <unk> around the world.
As one one one one one one one one one one one one one one one one one one one one one one one one one one one one one one one one one one one one one one one one one one one one one one one one one one one one one one one one one one one one one one one one one one percent of the
And this is a really reasonable <unk>
We talked about something that happens with often very young people in the column in the column that we start to start their life -- to 30 or 40 years ago -- associated with a wall and the chair was going to be the only choice.
We also talk about the population that they get to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to
Your only choice, a lot of times -- for a brain language, or some other <unk> -- it's the chair of <unk>
And this has been so for the past 500 years from its successful <unk> as I have to coordinate them.
So we decided to start to write a new chapter about mobility.
Let me introduce you to the <unk> which is using <unk> <unk> who makes it a <unk> in the column of the column -- and as a result couldn't go back to walk for 19 years until right now.
<unk> <unk> Thank you.
EB: <unk> is using our <unk> that <unk>
It has a bunch of sensors ...
It completely <unk> in the <unk> that they send signals to the computer <unk> here in the back.
There's also a lot of predictions that give the engines in the <unk> and in the <unk> and they make them with this <unk> and very natural <unk>
AB: I had 24 years in the top of my life, when a strange step on the air, it costs it <unk> <unk>
In a fraction of second, I lost a whole sense and all of the <unk> to the bottom.
Shortly time later, a doctor went to my room in the hospital, and he said, <unk> never go to <unk>
That happened about 19 years.
And so I took me to the last bit of the hope of my way.
The <unk> technology has allowed me to learn to <unk> it costs it down in <unk> and <unk> rocks and even building them on my hand.
But they haven't invented anything that allowed me to me so much now.
Thank you.
EB: As you can see, we have the technology, we have the devices to sit and talk with you.
It's in our hands, and we have all the potential here to change the life of the future generations -- not only for families, but to all of the users of <unk> to all.
AB: Thank you.
I just come back from a community that has the secret of human survival.
It's a place where women have the <unk> use sex to say, <unk> and the game is the order of the time, where a fun is something serious.
And no, it's not the <unk> <unk> or San Francisco.
Ladies and gentlemen, I'm going to be going to be going to go back to their feet.
This is the world of the <unk> <unk> of the <unk>
<unk> are along with the <unk> their <unk>
That means that we all share a common <unk> a red grandmother who lived about six million years.
Now chimpanzees are known by their <unk>
But unfortunately, we've made a lot too <unk> in this aspect of the human evolution.
But the <unk> tells us the other side of the coin.
While the chimpanzees are <unk> by the big types of big, <unk> society is in charge of females with power.
These guys have created something special that this leads to a very expensive society where violence is still not <unk>
But, unfortunately, <unk> are the less <unk> of the big <unk>
They live in the depths of the forest <unk> and it has been very hard to <unk>
The Congo is a <unk> an land of extraordinary biodiversity and beauty, but also the heart of the <unk> <unk> the stage of a dozen conflict that has been <unk> for decades, and led to almost so many deaths like the first World War World
It's not the wonder that this destruction also put in danger the survival of the <unk>
<unk> meat and the deforestation they do that you can't fill up or a stadium with the <unk> that they have in the world, and they are not safe to it.
However, in this land of violence and <unk> you can hear the <unk> <unk> <unk> the trees.
Who are these <unk>
We know how the apes <unk> the love, not the <unk> because they have sex <unk> <unk> and <unk> to drive conflicts and solve social problems.
I'm not saying that this is the solution to all the problems of humanity because the life of <unk> is more than the <unk>
The <unk> as the humans, I love to play throughout their life.
It is not only a car game.
So for us and for them and for them the game is fundamental to build <unk> and help the <unk>
We learn to <unk> and we learn the rules of the game.
The game is <unk> creativity and resilience and it has to see with the generation of <unk> diversity of the diversity of <unk> diversity of connections.
And when you look at the <unk> <unk> you see the roots <unk> the same of the <unk> the dance and the <unk>
The game is the gun that we do.
I don't know how you play you -- but I want to show you a couple of extra videos of the only <unk>
First of all, it's a <unk> game <unk>
Here we have a female and a female girls in a <unk>
Look at what's doing it.
It could be the evolutionary origin of the <unk> <unk>
I just think that in this case in this case, I love right?
Yeah.
So the sex game is common as much as a human game.
And this video is really interesting because <unk> this video is really interesting because it shows the <unk> to bring them <unk> as the <unk> and also how the game requires trust and <unk> the <unk> and the same time is the most fun.
But the game is <unk>
The game is <unk> you can take a lot of ways, some of which are more <unk> <unk> <unk> perhaps the place where the <unk>
And I want to <unk> this is <unk> a young woman that's playing with water <unk>
I think that as this, sometimes we play it, and we explore the limits of our deep worlds and <unk>
And it's that curious that we give us to go to <unk> and then the unexpected connections that we use is the real <unk>
So these are only small samples of understanding that <unk> us give us from our past and present.
But they also have a secret for our future, a future where we have to adapt to a world every more difficult and more hard and greater cooperation.
The secret is that the game is the key of these properties.
In other words, the game is our <unk> <unk>
To adapt to a world that changes we have to play.
But let's take it into the <unk> our ability to play.
The game is not <unk>
<unk> is <unk>
<unk> and humans and humans are not just <unk> and <unk>
When it looks at the least environment, you can be the moments in which is the more <unk>
So they taught them <unk> <unk> this gift of evolution and we play together as a <unk> creativity, and the <unk>
Thank you.
In New York I am responsible for a <unk> organization called <unk> <unk> <unk>
When I'm not going to fight our poverty, <unk> <unk> <unk> a <unk> <unk>
And in our city where the volunteers where the volunteers are going to get a highly effective personal personal personal <unk> you have to get to the place of the <unk>
I remember my first fire.
I was the second <unk> in the place, so I had a pretty high likelihood to go.
But even there was a career in foot against the other volunteers to get to the captain to <unk> and figure out what our task.
When I found the <unk> I was <unk> in a conversation with the <unk> that without doubt one of the worst days of life.
We were in the night night, she was standing outside the ball under a <unk> in <unk> <unk> while his house was in the corner.
The other vehicles that I just had to get before I was like, <unk> <unk> <unk>  And it was asked to go back to the <unk> and he asked them to go to the dog of my house.
<unk> I was <unk> <unk>
There was a lawyer or <unk> of money that, for the rest of your life, I would have to tell people that I went on a different building building to save a way to be living for five seconds.
Well, I was the audience.
The captain gave me a <unk>
He said, <unk> I need to get between home.
I need to be <unk> <unk> the <unk> and he took this woman a couple of <unk>
I was <unk>
It wasn't exactly what I was expected but <unk> I got the south, at the end of the <unk> spent to the <unk> <unk> which is going to turn out of the fire and I went to the fourth <unk> and I went to the fourth room in a couple of shoes.
I know what you're thinking, but I'm not a hero.
I took my head back by the staircase where I met my <unk> and the lovely dog on the main door of the main side.
<unk> of the house in the <unk> <unk> where it was the <unk> her <unk> a lot more attention than my mine.
A few weeks later, the police received a letter from the <unk> <unk> by the <unk> effort for the <unk> effort to save their house.
The <unk> that she noticed about the other was that somebody had been done even a couple of shoes.
And so much in my name of <unk> <unk> as in my name as a <unk> <unk> I am <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> in a <unk> scale but also it also <unk> and courage to <unk>
And you know what I've got to.
It has their own.
So, when I look at this room in the people who have been <unk> or they're going to be able to remind you this: I didn't know.
They don't wait to win the first million to make the difference in life.
If you have something to <unk> <unk> now.
<unk> food in a <unk> <unk> a park of the <unk>
They're <unk>
Not all the days we're going to have the opportunity to save the life of somebody but every day we're going to be able to influence the life.
So you walk into the <unk> <unk>
Thank you.
Bruno Giussani: <unk> <unk> <unk>
Mark <unk> Thank you.
This may look like <unk> but I'm a great <unk> of the <unk>
The first blocks of the particular blocks was moved in <unk> with a very simple idea of a <unk> <unk> that I sit on between yes.
Very quickly, these became a more used in the world.
They have allowed us to build more big things that us, as a buildings or the <unk> and <unk>
All of these blocks have become the <unk> of our time.
Almost a hundred years later, in 1900, to <unk> it was doing this.
He was called a <unk>
And in a few years ago, the <unk> <unk> came to all the home.
And they have been more than 400 billion or 75 dollars for every person in the planet.
There is not to be an engineer, to build beautiful buildings or boys.
<unk> <unk>
<unk> just adopted the <unk> <unk> the favorite in the world, and it became a fundamental piece of our imagination.
Meanwhile, exactly that same year, in the dopamine labs -- the next revolution was going to <unk> the new block of building a building building.
The transistor was a small unit of plastic that would take us from a <unk> world of <unk> <unk> about about other to a world where everything was <unk>
At the same time that the block of <unk> is allowed to create a lot more greater and more complex and more and more complex to the time.
But there is a <unk> <unk> <unk> was just for <unk>
I don't have no <unk> that the building blocks of our time are <unk> to the experts, so I decided to change it.
eight years ago, when I was in the Media Lab -- I started exploring the idea of taking the power of the engineers and designers.
I started to develop <unk>
I'm going to show you how they work.
<unk> are <unk> and every one with a specific tool.
They are <unk> to be a light, sound, and you can.
And the best thing about all of it is that they put together through it.
So you can't put it a wrong way.
<unk> have a source of color.
The green is the sun, the blue is the <unk> the <unk> is the entrance and the <unk>
So you just have to build a blue with a green and very fast and it can be able to start to make the biggest level.
A blue with one green is making light.
We can put a button in the middle and so we have a <unk>
If we change the button for a <unk> <unk> which is here, and now we have a <unk> light.
<unk> this <unk> to create more impact.
I'm going to stop it.
So beyond the simple game, <unk> are actually very popular.
And instead of having to be able to connect them and <unk> <unk> us allowed us to program using <unk> <unk>
And so to make it more fast or more <unk> just this message that makes them is more fast or more slow.
The idea of <unk> is that it's a <unk>
We want all the interactions in the world is <unk> in the world <unk> to use.
<unk> <unk> panels -- <unk> <unk>
We've been given to the kids to see them with them.
And it has been a incredible experience.
The best is how you start to understand the electronics of all the days that they don't learn in schools.
So for example, how a light works, or why the door of a space is connected <unk> or how a iPod responds to it.
We also have led to public schools.
So for example, the designers have no experience in <unk> they start to play with <unk> as a material.
And here you can see, with glass samples and <unk> we have <unk> <unk>
<unk>   A few weeks ago we took <unk> to the designers from the <unk> School of Rhode
Here's an example of a project that have already done, a <unk> <unk> <unk>
But thank you here's my favorite project.
It's a <unk> <unk> which has fear of darkness.
For these <unk> engineers, it became the other material, the electronics became another material.
And we want this material is the <unk> of all.
So it has a open code has a open show.
You can look at the website to download all of the <unk> and <unk>
We want to take a world of <unk> <unk> and collaborators because this world in which we live, this world is us.
So let's go back and <unk>
Thank you.
I'm going to tell you to talk about the <unk>
I work in the industry of the solar industry.
And my small company is going to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to
We did a lot of collaboration of collaboration with.
This is a small video of what we do.
<unk> <unk>
You can take a little bit in <unk>
<unk> we can continue to be able to keep the video to a side of a side here.
No.
This is not ...
All right.
The solar technology.
Oh, I have been the time.
All right. Thank you very much.
A couple of years ago a couple years ago to recruit the best designers and <unk> to take a year and work on a year and work in a environment that means almost everything that we were supposed to work in government.
<unk> was called <unk> for <unk> and it would be like about <unk> <unk>
<unk> some members every year and we put them with the <unk>
In addition to the United States at the United States in the United States in the United States of the <unk> the <unk> <unk>
They made great <unk> worked with the <unk>
Your task is to show the chances of technology.
<unk> <unk>
At the <unk> of the city of Boston.
Here it looks like if you were able to get a <unk> but what you really look for is that somebody -- when it comes to the snow because it knows that it's not very good for the snow because it's covered by a meter of snow.
How did you go to ask this way to do this way.
Last year in Boston we had a team of <unk> <unk>
They were there in February February and at that moment -- a long year.
He realized that the city never <unk> these <unk>
But one of the members of the members called <unk> <unk> I noticed something else, that the citizens are <unk> with <unk> <unk> in front of them.
So it did like any good <unk> I developed a app.
It's a nice app where you can take a <unk>
You know, <unk> <unk> when <unk>
By doing it, you put a name, in this case, I put it <unk>
If you don't ask it, somebody can <unk>
I mean, it has a <unk>
It's a <unk>
Maybe it's the smallest of the age of the age of the age of the past.
But it makes something that any other technology is <unk>
And it turns out in <unk>
A responsible for the city of the city of <unk> to see this app that realized that I could be a little bit for the <unk> but that the citizens will get out of <unk>
It's very important to work these <unk> <unk> but people get <unk>
So they ask the citizens that the <unk>
And then Bob decided to use it to make the citizens <unk> the <unk> <unk>
And Chicago just from <unk> to make people <unk> to be <unk> when they <unk>
So now we know about nine cities that <unk> use it.
And this has been <unk> without <unk> and natural and natural.
If you know a little bit of <unk> technology will know that this doesn't happen.
The citizen of software has a couple of years.
Last year in Boston we had a team working in a project that took three people for two months and a half months and a half months and a half months and a half months and a half months and a half months and a half months and a half months and a half months and a half months and a half months and a half months and a half
It was a tool that the parents could choose the best school for their children.
And then they told us that they have been done for the normal channels would be taken at least two years and get about two million dollars.
And that's not anything.
Now there is a project in the power of California in California that until the moment has half 2,000 million dollars and doesn't work.
And there are projects like this in every level of government.
So a app that you have a couple of days of days and it became a kind of <unk> <unk> <unk> to the institution of government.
It suggests the best ways to work, not as a lot of people think that it should be.
Not as a technological company but more good as the own Internet.
I mean, without <unk> and <unk>
And that's important.
But the most important thing about this app is that it represents the way to address the question of the government that has the new <unk> not as a problem of a <unk> institution but as a problem of collective action.
And that's very good because it turns out that we're very good to be very good for the collective action.
And there is a very big community of people who are building the tools that we are going to get together together with <unk>
And it's not only <unk> for <unk> but there are hundreds of people in all the country that contribute to apps -- all the days in their own communities.
They're not given by the government.
Do you have a great frustration to that but not <unk> the <unk>
And this people knows something that we have lost from life.
And it's that if we let the feelings about the feelings about politics, the row in the <unk> <unk> <unk> and all those things that are going to put us <unk> the government is that we do together because we don't have no <unk>
Now, a lot of people have transformed the government.
If you are one of those people, I would ask you to be <unk> because things are changing.
<unk> is not <unk> the government.
And since the government in the end of the end of all, you remember that of the <unk> the <unk> the way of thinking about thinking about the way to produce the change.
I didn't know a lot of government when I started with this.
And as a lot of people thought that the government was going to choose people to <unk> <unk>
Well, after two years I've come to the conclusion that the government is about all of the <unk> question.
This is the <unk> center of services, and information.
It's the place that I was going to happen if you get <unk> in America.
Scott <unk> this call.
I ended up <unk> in the base of global knowledge.
I don't found anything about the animal <unk>
And he finally said, "Hey, you can open the doors of the house, to put music very strong music and see if you get <unk>
And it worked.
But that wasn't the end of the <unk>
Boston doesn't have a center of <unk>
It has a <unk> website called <unk> <unk>
They don't get that story.
It was the work in the <unk> of New York <unk> <unk> <unk>
A day, this was actually this <unk> <unk> in my <unk> <unk> I don't know if it's dead.
How do I do for <unk>
<unk> dynamic is different.
Scott was talking about the person.
In <unk> <unk> everything is <unk> so you all can see this.
In this case, you saw a neighbor.
The next report said, "I go to the place, I found the <unk> <unk> behind the house.
<unk> Yeah.
I took the <unk> I went home.
Good <unk> <unk>
Very simple.
This is great. It's the <unk> of digital and the physical thing.
And it is also a great example of the income income of the collaboration of collaboration in the collaboration of collaboration with <unk>
But it's also a great example of government as platform.
And here's not necessarily I mean, the definition definition of platform.
I'm going to talk about a platform for people and help others.
So a citizen helped another way to other but here the government had a <unk> role.
Two people.
And it might have connected to the services of being necessary but the next is a better alternative and more complex than the services.
When a door helps other people -- <unk> people.
If we call the control of animals, that costs a lot of money.
A important thing that we have to think about government is that it's not the same thing that policy.
A lot of people have <unk> but thinks you think you is the code of the other.
What our car system is <unk>
How many times they have chosen to a <unk> leader sometimes spend a lot of energy to choose a new community and then we hope that government <unk> our values and <unk> our needs but then we don't see changes.
That is that the government is like a huge ocean and politics is the <unk> layer of 15 <unk>
On underneath it is what we call <unk>
And we say that word.
But it is that <unk> which is that we need that that we basically have a thing that we built in our <unk> that other thing, and in a consequence we're losing the power.
People thinks politics is <unk>
If we want to be that this institution is going to be able to make the <unk> it is <unk>
Because it is where the real job of government.
We have to live with the power of government.
That makes the <unk> movement.
They have <unk>
It's a group of clinical citizens who have written a very <unk> report from the answer of the response to the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> of the <unk> <unk>
That's not no political activism is <unk> <unk>
And so that we have been <unk> to the government, it's time that we ask us what we want to leave our children.
You have to see the huge challenges that they have to see.
I really think that we will know where we have to go without solving the institution that can be able to act in <unk>
We can't keep the government, we need to be more <unk>
The good news is that with technology is possible to rethink the function of government that can apply <unk> to society.
There are a generation that grew up with the Internet and knows that it's not so hard to be able to be able to be able to be able to be <unk> the systems of the right way.
The average age of our members is from 28 years -- so I, I'm a generation that many of them.
This is a generation that has grown up to take the word and giving that almost for granted.
They're not giving that battle that we all face about who are going to <unk> you all go to speak.
You can think of their opinions in any channel at the same time and they do.
So when you face the problem of government doesn't care about a lot of their voices.
They're using your hands.
They get their hands to the work to program to make the applications that do a better government.
And those applications can allow us to use the hands to improve our communities.
It can be a <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> a <unk> <unk> which has a <unk>
Since then, we were always used those <unk> and many people do it.
But these applications are like <unk> digital <unk> that we're not only the <unk> we're not only the government of government we pay and we get services.
We are more than that, we are citizens.
And we're not going to fix the government until you don't get the <unk>
So I want to ask all the <unk> when it's about the important things that we have to do together, all of them are going to do together, all of them are going to be a crowd of <unk> or we also have a crowd of <unk>
Thank you.
This is for me a real honor.
I've spent the highest part of the time in <unk> <unk> and in the death of women.
I've spent the highest part of my life in communities and places where there are a lot of difference?
And I will be here in TED seeing and listen to these <unk> I has a lot of energy.
One of the things that I noticed in this short time, is that TED has <unk>
And the things that they say here have been impact around the world.
<unk> if something comes from TED, has a sense and a force that would not have a sense of other way.
I say this because I think identity is <unk> important.
Here we've seen presentations great.
And I think that we have learned that the words of a professor can have a lot of sense, but if they teach them with a lot of sense, but if they teach them with a lot of common meaning to have a special common thing.
A doctor can make things good <unk> if it's <unk> it can make a lot more.
This is why I want to talk about the power of view.
I didn't learned this in the practice of the reason, my work.
I learned about my grandmother.
I grew up in a traditional house of a <unk> family. It was a <unk> that was my grandmother.
It was <unk> I had power.
It was the last word in the entire time.
She <unk> a lot of the <unk> in our home.
It was <unk> people who had been dead.
His parents were born in the <unk> in <unk> on the <unk>
She was born about the <unk> and their experience with <unk> <unk> the way we saw the world.
She was <unk> but it was also <unk>
When I was a little bit and I looked at it, and I took me a good <unk>
It would be so strong that I could barely breathe and then I <unk>
One or two hours later, I went to <unk> and I said, <unk> I still feel my <unk>
And if I said that not, I was going to take me again and if I was saying that I took me in peace.
I had this human quality that I did always want to be close to it.
The only problem is that I had 10 children.
My mother was the least of the 10.
In <unk> when I was going to happen a time with it, it wasn't easy to capture their time and your attention.
My <unk> were running everywhere.
I remember when I was eight  nine years ago, I went to the room and there were running all of my feet.
My grandmother was on the other side of the room and I looked at it.
I thought it was a game.
So I looked at it, and I said, but she was very serious.
After 15 or 20 minutes, she got left the room, and he took me out of the hand and said, "You know, <unk> <unk> <unk>
I remember this as if it was yesterday.
I never could.
It took me outside and he said, <unk> I'm going to tell you something, but you can't tell you something.
I said, "It's well, <unk>
She said, "Well, <unk> <unk> I said, <unk>
Then I sat up and I looked at me, and he said, "I want you to know that I've been <unk>
And <unk> <unk> you're <unk>
He said, "I think you can do what you <unk>
I never could.
Then he said, "I want to take me three things, <unk>
I said, <unk> <unk>
And he said, "Well, first I want to be <unk> is that you always want to get your <unk>
<unk> <unk> is my <unk> and you have to <unk> that we always get <unk>
As I <unk> my mom, I said, "Yes, <unk> <unk>
And then he said, "It's second I want to be <unk> is that we always get the right thing, although the right thing is <unk>
I thought and I said, "Yes, <unk> <unk>
Then he finally said, "It's third I want to be <unk> is that I never <unk> <unk>
I had nine years old, and I said, "Yes, <unk> <unk>
I grew up in the field, in the south of the <unk> I have a brother a year and a child, a year of <unk>
When I had 14  I had 14  I came home with a set of <unk> <unk> I don't know where the <unk> came up to my sister and me and I went to me for the forest.
We just have doing the <unk> <unk>
He took a <unk> <unk> he gave my sister, she took a little bit and I took me to me.
I said, "No, no, no. It's not. You know, you're going to take <unk>
My brother said, <unk> <unk> and you always make the same thing that us.
I took something -- your sister would be a <unk>
I said, "No, I don't feel okay.
Then my brother looked at me.
And he said, "What do you show you a <unk>
I took me with <unk> and <unk> "Oh, not be that you're still thinking about the conversation with <unk>
I said, "But what you're <unk>
He said, <unk> tells us all the grandchildren that are <unk>
I became <unk>
I have to admit something about you.
I'll tell you something that you probably shouldn't say.
I know this is <unk>
But I have <unk> years and I can admit that I've never taken no <unk> or a <unk>
I don't say this thinking that it's a <unk> I tell you for the power that has the identity.
When we create the right kind of identity, we say things to the others that they really don't see sense.
We can't get to do things that they don't think of it.
I think my grandmother actually believed that all their grandchildren were serious.
My grandfather had been <unk> for the <unk>
My <unk> died of diseases related to <unk>
And these were the things that the things that with it, we had <unk>
Now, I try to talk about our social system.
This country is today very different than it was about 40 years.
In <unk> there were <unk>
Today, there are a million.
In the United States we have the biggest rate of <unk> the world.
We have seven million people in freedom
And this <unk> <unk> in my view, has changed fundamentally our world.
In poor communities or <unk> are so much <unk> so much of these facts.
One of every three black of each three black and the 30 years is in prison or the <unk>
In the <unk> of the whole country, the <unk> <unk> Washington, 50 percent of all the young young kids are in prison or in prison or freedom.
Our system is not just <unk> in front of business, also what's about poverty.
In this country we have a <unk> system that is a lot better if you're rich and <unk> that if you're poor and security.
It's not <unk> but wealth which is going to take the results.
And it seems very <unk>
The policy of fear and <unk> do you believe that these are not problems.
We are <unk>
It seems interesting.
We are looking at our work in our work with some very <unk>
In my hospital in <unk> so as in other states, you have <unk> of rights for always if you have a <unk>
Now now at the <unk> the <unk> of the <unk> population has lost the right <unk>
And if we put it to the next 10 years to the level of a loss of rights to be so <unk> as before that we had <unk> the law of the right <unk>
We have this wonderful, silence.
I have children.
Many of my clients are very young people.
America is the only country of the world where it comes to two years to die in prison.
We have in this hospital prison for kids, without a chance to go out of it.
Now now we are in the process of some <unk>
The only country of the world.
<unk> people in the death of death.
This matter of death death is interesting.
In a certain sense we have <unk> to think that the end is, people deserve to die for the <unk> <unk>
A very unusual question.
But you can think about another way about how we're in our identity.
There's another way of <unk> it's not to decide if people deserve to die for the crimes of <unk> but if we were able to be able to be able to be able to kill it.
This is interesting.
<unk> death in the United States is <unk> by error.
From every nine people -- <unk> has gotten a <unk> which is <unk> which is <unk> and <unk> of death from women.
A rate of <unk> <unk> a license of every <unk>
This is interesting.
You wouldn't have been able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be <unk>
But in some way we get up the problem.
It's not our problem.
It's not our teachers.
It's not our struggle.
I talk about these things.
I'm talking about race and this issue of if we were going to be <unk>
It is interesting that in my class with students on history -- I talk about the <unk>
I'm talking about the <unk> the time I started at the end of the <unk> and it was looking at the end of the <unk> World War.
We don't know a lot of this.
But for the American Americans in this country, it was a age of the <unk>
In many communities people had fear of being <unk>
I was concerned to be <unk>
The economic threat was what it has the <unk>
Now there are the biggest people that are going to come up and say, <unk> <unk> you say, <unk> <unk> <unk> people who let me stop to say that in our story of the first time with <unk> after the <unk>
They ask me to say, "No, you know, I grew up with that."
The age of terrorism was born with the <unk> and decades of the <unk> and <unk>
In this country we have a dynamic that we don't like to talk about our problems.
We don't like to talk about our story.
And that's why we haven't understood the meaning of what we have done we have done.
All of the time you get up with others.
We were going to create <unk> and conflict.
It costs us to talk about <unk> I think it's because we're not willing to get them with a real process, and <unk>
In South Africa, people understood that you couldn't overcome the <unk> <unk> without a engagement with the truth and <unk>
In Rwanda, even before the police had this <unk> but in this country we haven't done it.
I was in Germany giving you TED on death of death.
It was fascinating because one of the teachers were hearing after my presentation and he said, "You know that it's good to listen to what they <unk>
<unk> didn't have death in Germany.
<unk> we can never be able to be <unk>
The room became silence and a lady said, "I don't have a way that with our story, we can be able to get on the death of human beings.
It would be <unk> that we have, and <unk> and <unk> we would get to <unk>
<unk> about this.
How do we feel in a world where a nation like Germany, <unk> people, especially if you were in the most <unk>
We could not be <unk>
It would be <unk>
And yet there is this <unk>
I think our identity is in danger.
If we actually don't worry about these issues so hard, things and wonderful things are, yet <unk>
We love innovation.
We love the technology.
And we love the entertainment.
But we're going to bring those <unk> are <unk> by the suffering, the <unk> <unk> <unk>
In my view, it is necessary to integrate both these things.
We've been talking about the need to have more hope, more than the basic challenges with the basic challenges of the life of the life of this complex world.
I think that you want to say about the more time thinking and talking about the poor, the <unk> who never come to TED.
I think that in some way, something that is within our way.
It's true that we have to believe in issues that we haven't seen it.
So we are, even though it will be so <unk> so closely with it.
And with innovation with religion with creativity.
These things come from ideas -- also by the <unk>
This connection to the heart of the heart is what you get to happen not only in the brilliant and <unk> but also in the dark and it is.
<unk> <unk> the great leader <unk> talked about this.
He said, "When we were in Europe where we were in Europe, the <unk> -- we want all kinds of things, but mostly what we needed was hope, compassion for the debate one will be in sites and being <unk>
Well, that <unk> for the spirit is basically in the heart of what I believe, still in communities like TED, must <unk>
There is no <unk> <unk> with technology and design that allowed us to be really humans if we don't even pay the energy for poverty, to <unk> to <unk> to the <unk>
Now I want to get <unk> that these thoughts make a lot more important than if we have all of these things.
We go to <unk>
I had the great <unk> being a very young lawyer to know <unk> <unk>
These women were used to speak.
Because the lady <unk> I call me to say, <unk> comes on the lady <unk> we are going to bring them to talk to speak.
You want to come and <unk>
I said, "I say, "I know it <unk>
And so she said, "Well, and what do you do when you get <unk>
I <unk> <unk>
So I was going to be just the <unk>
It was something very <unk>
And in one occasion, I was there, listening to these <unk> and after a couple of hours, Dr. <unk> became me to me and he said, "Well, <unk> <unk> which is that idea of justice <unk>
Tell me what you're trying to do."
And I started to give you my tea.
I said, "Well, we're trying to question the <unk>
We tried to help those who have been <unk> <unk>
We tried to be able to be able to take the <unk> and discrimination in the greenhouse Valley.
We tried to end up with the <unk> of life, without freedom <unk> for children.
We tried to do something about death from death.
We tried to reduce the population in the prison.
We tried to end up with the <unk> <unk>
I gave all my best speech and the end of me looked at me and said, "You know, <unk> <unk> <unk>
And <unk> <unk> <unk>
In that moment, the <unk> <unk> I put me the finger on the face and said, "It's why you have to be very much but very <unk>
I think that the TED community has to be much more <unk>
We have to find the way to take these problems, those problems, that suffering.
Because the humanity depends on compassion for others.
I've learned some very simple things in my work.
I've been <unk> in things.
I've come to understand and I believe that every one of us is the worst of us that we have been able to be <unk>
I think that's true for all the world in the planet.
I'm convinced that if somebody says a <unk> but it's not because it's a <unk>
I'm sure if somebody takes something that you're not going to be a <unk>
You know if somebody kills another, is not that it's a <unk>
So I think there is a basic dignity in the people who must be <unk> by the law.
And I also think that in a lot of parts of this country and without sure in many parts of the world, the opposite of poverty is not the wealth.
That's not it.
I really think that in many parts of poverty is the justice.
And then finally, I think that though it's very <unk> so very beautiful <unk> so very <unk> -- not the way of our technology, by our <unk> not by our mental ability or <unk>
At the end of the end of a society, not by the way of a society, not because of the way you try to the powerful <unk> and <unk> but by the way you try to the poor, the <unk>
Because it's in this context as we started to understand real issues about what we are.
I feel <unk> I'm going to end up with a story.
Sometimes I do a lot of force.
<unk> <unk> like all.
Sometimes those ideas are beyond my <unk> <unk>
I've been able to be able to be <unk> with a lot of <unk>
I'm going to jail and I see my mother from 13 and 14 years ago, who have been <unk> so they have been <unk>
And I start thinking, how can it be?
How can a place to turn somebody in what it isn't wrong.
<unk> <unk> as a <unk> but I see a child.
One night I was <unk> <unk> God, if you can turn it in something that you can't turn it on something that you can't have <unk>
Yeah, <unk> <unk> has <unk>
You should ask something about it.
As I was very afternoon, I couldn't think that, but I started working on a <unk>
I had a client of 14 years old, a small <unk>
I started working on the <unk> with a <unk> who said, <unk> for that my black client is known as a white white <unk> of a <unk>
In the <unk> I put there there had been <unk> <unk> in the <unk> in the behavior of the police and in the process.
There was a <unk> line about how in this country there is no ideal -- but all of a lack of <unk>
On the next morning I felt about that <unk> <unk> would be a dream, or really the <unk>
For my <unk> not only the <unk> but I had sent to the <unk>
It was about two months, I had been done.
And I finally <unk> my God, I have to go to the <unk> for this case he said.
I got the car and I felt really <unk> <unk>
I went on the car to the <unk>
I thought this would be very hard and <unk>
I ended up with the car.
I was going to go on the <unk> when I found me with a black man, <unk> was the <unk> <unk>
When I looked at me to me and he said, "What is you?
I said, "I'm a <unk> he said, "It's you <unk> I said yes.
So I went to me and <unk>
And I <unk> on the <unk>
He said, "I'm a proud of <unk>
I have to tell you now that that was <unk>
That is connected to my own, with my identity with the ability that we all have to contribute to the community with a vision of hope.
Well, I went to the living room.
When you go back to me at the night I saw me.
And he said, "Do you wrote this <unk> <unk>
I said, "Yes, Mr. I went back, and we started <unk>
People started to get them to get all <unk>
I was that I had written those <unk>
They came up the <unk> the <unk> <unk>
As soon, without knowing how the room was full of people -- all of people -- all of the <unk> because we talked about poverty, because we talked about poverty, because we talked about inequality.
With the <unk> of the eye to see the <unk> that was and <unk>
It was going on the window and <unk> to hear all that <unk>
<unk> walking for here and for there.
And finally, this old black, with <unk> face in the room and I felt behind me, almost in the table of the <unk>
A few 10 minutes later, <unk> <unk> a <unk>
For the <unk> a <unk> <unk> <unk> because the <unk> was in the room.
The <unk> is <unk> about the old black
He said, <unk> what do you do in the room of <unk>
And the old black became <unk> I looked at the <unk> I looked at me and he said, <unk> this room in <unk> to tell this young room in the goal of <unk>
I have come to TED because I think that many of you understand that the moral ocean of the universe is very big, but it turns out to justice.
And that we can't be really human humans -- if we don't care about human rights and <unk>
And what our survival is going to get to the other others.
What our visions of technology, design media and creativity must be <unk> to the <unk> <unk> and justice.
And above all of all, to those of the people who share this, I just want to tell you that we keep the view in the goal.
Thank you very much.
Chris Anderson: You know, you hear and see a question of the audience, of this community, to help you something.
Something is not a <unk> What can we do?
<unk> There are several opportunities on the <unk>
If you live in the state of California, for example, there will be a <unk> this power in which is going to make a effort to <unk> the money that they spend today in policies in policy.
For example, here in California, they're going to spend billion dollars in death death in the next five years.
And despite this, the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> not <unk> in <unk>
The <unk> of the <unk> they don't get anything.
Here's a chance of change.
This <unk> is going to propose that <unk> these money to make the law, to security.
I think there is a very much opportunity a very <unk>
CA: There has been a huge <unk> in the <unk> in the United States, in the past three decades.
Some of the <unk> is that it has to see with the biggest rate of <unk>
What would you tell you that you think is that?
<unk> -- actually, the rate of <unk> with violence has been a relatively relatively relatively popular.
The big growth in <unk> in this country is not for crimes with violence.
It's the wrong war against drugs.
It's why it comes on this dramatic increase in the population.
And we asked us to convince us for the 2030, of <unk>
We have three different causes to bring people to the food chain, by taking a <unk> for small crimes against the <unk> instead of doing those resources to their victims.
I think we have to make more to help the victims of <unk> and not less.
It seems to be that our extra philosophy about security, not nothing for anything.
I think that is the orientation that has to change.
CA: <unk> have been excited about today today today here.
You're very simple.
Thank you very much. Thank you.
<unk> <unk> the threats for the death of <unk>

Oh, my God!
Peter <unk> These are just some of the clips that I got in the past six months -- you could be from the last six days or the last six years.
The idea is that the media of the press would be used to be a good news because our minds will pay attention.
And that responds to a very good thing.
In every second of every day our senses, they get many more data than the brain can be <unk>
And as nothing matters more than you remember the first <unk> of all those data is a ancient fragment of the lobe called <unk>
<unk> is our <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
<unk> and <unk> all of the information looking for something in the environment that I could make it harm.
So that of a <unk> <unk> <unk> look at <unk>
That old saying of the <unk> "If there are blood, <unk> it's very true.
And since all of the digital devices are going to make us very good things, the seven days of the week -- 24 hours at the day, it's not about people to be <unk>
I don't feel that people think that the world is wrong in the same.
But maybe it's not like that.
Maybe in change, what's really happening is that we have <unk>
Maybe the huge progress done in the last century for a series of forces is <unk> that we have the potential to create a world in the next three decades.
I'm not saying that we don't have our good <unk> climate change, the absence of species, the <unk> of water and <unk> <unk>
As human beings are very good for <unk> the problems and the time, we just have them.
<unk> what happened in the last century to see where we go.
In the last hundred years, the average of life has more than <unk> the average income per capita per capita per capita <unk> has gone around around the world.
Your mortality has got 10 times.
In addition, the cost of the food, of the food -- and the communications, has sent from 10 to 1,000 times.
Steve <unk> I showed us that we are living the age of the history of humanity.
And Charles <unk> that the global event spent 25 percent of 25 percent over the last 40 years.
We're really living a little bit.
A lot of people do it.
And we keep <unk> expectations every single time.
In fact, you know, the meaning of poverty.
<unk> today in America, a lot of the people who live under the line of poverty have electricity, water, <unk> <unk> and <unk> and cars.
The <unk> <unk> of the <unk> century, the <unk> of the planet would never have been born with such <unk>
<unk> a lot of this is the technology.
My good friend Ray Wilson showed you that any tool that <unk> in the technology of the information comes on this <unk> the <unk> <unk> and <unk> the performance of the price in about about 24 to 24
So the phone that they have in the pocket is a million times more expensive, and a few times faster than a <unk> <unk>
Now look at this <unk>
It's the <unk> <unk> for the last hundred years.
I want you to take two things in this <unk>
First of all, the phrase that is -- in good and bad time in the war and in peace, in <unk> in <unk> in depression, and in the <unk>
It's the <unk> of computers used to build computers faster.
It didn't stop any of the big challenges.
And even though it's <unk> in an law to the left, it is going to go down.
The growth rate of technology is in the same time more quickly.
And in this <unk> <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> there is a series of powerful technologies with the ones that we do.
The computer in the cloud, that my friends of <unk> call computing computing and networks, the 3D printing and their printing printing and their printing challenge and their energy capacity and their ability to recreate them into all the planet, biology medicine and food, medicine and <unk>
I mean, how many you saw the victory in <unk> <unk> <unk>
It was <unk>
I asked them in the newspapers the best <unk> that we <unk>
And I loved this: <unk> <unk> <unk>
It's not a easy.
It's going to be the human language.
Imagine this artificial intelligence in the cloud, available for all in the cell phone.
Four years ago, here at TED, Ray Kurzweil and I, we launched a new university called <unk> <unk>
We teach these technologies to our car, and in particular, how can you be used to solve the big challenges of humanity.
And every year we asked them to play a company, or a product or service, that can affect the lives of billion people in a decade.
Think about that, the fact that the fact that a group of students today can be a group of billion people.
30 years ago, that would be <unk>
We can point a <unk> of companies that have been done.
When I think about creating <unk> it doesn't mean to create life <unk> for each of the <unk> is about creating a life of it.
It's about to take that that is <unk> and make it <unk>
You see, <unk> is <unk> and technology is a force that it looks like.
I'll give you an example.
It's a story of <unk> in the <unk>
He is the guy of the left.
<unk> <unk> the king of <unk>
<unk> troops <unk> with covered and the same <unk> with covered in gold.
But the king of <unk> was <unk> with covered with <unk>
You see, the <unk> was the most valuable metal of the <unk> <unk> and <unk>
So the tip of the <unk> to Washington, is <unk>
You see, although the <unk> is the <unk> of the mass of the Earth, it doesn't come as a <unk>
It's <unk> by oxygen and <unk>
But then the <unk> and it made the <unk> something that we use it as if it was <unk>
<unk> this works to the future.
Let's think about energy.
Ladies and gentlemen, we're in a planet <unk> by 5,000 times more energy than we use in a year.
They come on the Earth -- 16 <unk> of energy every <unk>
It's not about <unk> but <unk>
And there's good news.
This year, for the first time, the cost of the solar power in India is 50 percent less than the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> <unk> against 17
The cost of the solar energy 50 percent last year.
Last month ago, MIT published a study that shows that at the end of the decade, in the <unk> parts of the United States in the United States in the United States in the United States in the United States in the United States in the United States, with 15 cents <unk>
And if we have energy, we also have <unk>
Let's talk about the wars of the water.
Do you remember when you have been able to be able to turn it into the space space on the Earth, in 1990, then I spent <unk>
<unk> a <unk> picture of <unk>
<unk> <unk>
Because we live in a planet of water.
We live in a planet covered in 70 percent of water.
Yeah, the <unk> is water, the percent of two percent is ice, and we set up by the <unk> of the water of the planet, but there is a hope.
It's a technology available not in 10  20 years ago, but right now.
It comes <unk>
In a conversation with Chicago <unk> this morning, one of the innovators of the <unk> I'd like to share with you, gave me to share with you, my technology called <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> is the size of a small boat.
It is able to take a thousand gallons of water to the day of any source of any source of the <unk> <unk> <unk> water, a <unk> for less than two cents the <unk>
The president of Coca-Cola is just a major test of hundreds of hundreds of these units in the developing world.
If that comes around, and I have the confidence in which it is that it would be, <unk> <unk> <unk> in <unk> countries.
This is a <unk> innovation for this technology.
And we've seen it.
My God, we are going to get to 70 percent of the <unk> in the world in the world in the world in the world in the world of <unk>
<unk> that <unk> <unk> has better access in the middle of Kenya that the president was about 25 years.
And to tell you with a smart phone with Google, has access to more knowledge and information that the president was 15 years ago.
And it lives in a world of information of information and business that no one might have been <unk>
<unk> that that, the things that you and I have paid tens of thousands of dollars and hundreds of thousands of dollars and music technology <unk> and music technology is now <unk> and they lose value of market with cell phones.
Maybe the best thing is when you play the applications in health.
The month, I had the pleasure of <unk> with the <unk> <unk> something called the <unk> X <unk> <unk> 10 million dollars.
We are going to focus to the teams of the world to <unk> these technologies in a cell device with the <unk> and because it has <unk> you can be <unk> you can be <unk>
To win it has to make better <unk> that a medical team.
Imagine this device in the middle of the world in the world that there are no doctors, where the <unk> <unk> is about 25 and there are the <unk> workers of health.
When this device <unk> a <unk> virus.
But this is the biggest force of produce a <unk> world.
I call it the billion <unk>
The white lines here are the population.
So we have been going to pass the brand of the seven million.
In the way, the best protection against the <unk> explosion is to give the world and health.
In 2010, we had less than two billion people in <unk>
To take it about two billion five billion users of the Internet.
Three billion minds never before <unk> which is going to get to the global project.
What would you want these people?
What would you do? What do you say <unk>
And instead of a economic <unk> we will have the most economic increase of the story.
These people represent tens of billion dollars in the global economy.
And <unk> of more health because of the <unk> of a better education with the <unk> Institute and because of the use of <unk> and the computer use it will be more productive than never before.
What can you give us three million members of the <unk> <unk> and <unk>
What about the voices never before <unk>
What if you give them to the <unk> where they are, a voice to be <unk> and we can act for the first time.
What do you take these three <unk>
And if they are not not <unk>
Something that I learned with the <unk> <unk> is that young teams are used by the passion with a goal of course, you can do things that before they could only do the big corporations and the time.
I'm going to end up a story that I really <unk>
There is a program that maybe some of you know.
It's called <unk>
<unk> in the University of Washington, in Seattle.
It's a game where people can take a sequence sequence and figure out the way that is going to be able to get the protein.
<unk> determine the structure and <unk>
It's a very important thing.
And so far, it was a problem of <unk>
They've been released with this <unk> teachers between others.
And then hundreds of thousands of people are going to come up and started <unk>
And it has shown that today, the <unk> power of human patterns is better to be able to be able to make the best computers.
Ladies and gentlemen, what gives me a huge confidence in the future is that we have more power as people to take the big challenges of the planet.
We have the tools with this exponential technology.
We have the passion of <unk> <unk>
We have the capital of the <unk>
And we have three billion minds that are going to be <unk> to work in the solution of big challenges and make what we needed to do.
We have in front of some extraordinary years.
Thank you.
I'm going to talk about a very <unk> idea.
<unk> <unk>
And as the idea can be inspired in a minute, before you give you three examples to do time.
The first story is about Charles <unk> one of my <unk>
He was here, as you know, in <unk>
You may think that <unk> <unk> but it wasn't like this.
It's actually <unk> fish.
And it goes to one of them as a very <unk>
It was <unk>
It was a lot of it a lot to the decade of <unk>
Now the fish is in the <unk> <unk> of the <unk>
But we've heard this story a lot of times about <unk> and other places, so that doesn't have nothing of special.
But the case is that we're still going to be <unk>
We still think they're <unk>
<unk> they still say that they're still <unk>
So what happens here?
The second story, it also shows another <unk> the <unk> of the <unk>
Because I was there in <unk> studying a <unk> in Africa.
I was there, because I grew up in Europe and then I wanted to work in Africa.
I thought I could <unk>
I took me a lot of the sun and I was convinced that I was not there.
This is my first exhibition to the sun.
<unk> was surrounded by <unk> and as you can see, from a few <unk>
There were <unk> of about 20 <unk> <unk> <unk>
And the <unk> of this <unk> was very abundant and spent for a good time, so it was made over the middle of the middle of it.
When I went up there 27 years after the amount of fish had gone in half.
<unk> five <unk>
<unk> a genetic pressure.
There was still fish.
In a certain way, they were still happy.
And the fish were still happy to be there.
I mean, nothing to anticipate but everything has changed.
My third story is that I went on the introduction of the <unk> <unk> in Asia.
In the 1970s, <unk> started in the <unk> <unk> made a lot of business projects.
The developing development was forced to the countries that they had 100 <unk> <unk> the industrial <unk>
And this is a pretty good boat, he called the <unk> four.
I went to fish in it, and we had studies in the south of the North China -- and all of all, in the <unk>
What there was we covered was something <unk>
<unk> now the bottom of the sea.
The 90 percent of what we ended up were <unk> other animals that are in the way.
And most of the fish are a small bit about a little bit of <unk> <unk> that are fish fish fish <unk>
In short, the bottom of the sea came to the covered and then it was <unk>
These images are extraordinary because the transition is very quickly.
In a year, you make a study and then you start the <unk>
The bottom of being a <unk> <unk> <unk> in this case, to be a <unk>
This is a <unk>
They don't <unk> <unk> because they were <unk>
A time we cut a job.
I still was still <unk>
So they wanted to <unk> because it was a good food.
This mountain <unk> is what the fishermen every time you're going to a area that they have never fish.
But there is not <unk>
<unk> the world but we don't remember it.
It takes the point of beginning to the new level, without remember what was there.
If you <unk> this happens something like this.
In the axis of the axis we have a lot of <unk> biodiversity, a lot of <unk> the <unk> of the country, the water supply network.
And that changes with the time, it changes because people do things with <unk>
Every generation to use the images <unk> the beginning of their conscious life as the normal and it turns out to play.
The difference is that they make the loss of loss of the loss of loss of the loss of the loss of the loss of the loss of the loss of the loss of the loss of the loss of the loss of the loss of the loss of the loss of the loss of the loss of the loss of the loss of the loss of the loss of
But they don't make the loss that happened.
You can look at the <unk>
And at the end of the end of the end of the <unk>
And that, in great things, it's what we want to do now.
We want to keep things that they don't are, or they're not what they are.
But you need to think that this problem affects the people when the societies are <unk> no animals without knowing what they have done until about generations later.
Because, obviously, a animal which is very simple: before <unk> is a little bit.
You don't lose animals.
You lost a lot of animals.
Even if this doesn't take it as a great <unk>
With the time, we focus in the big animals and in a very large sea of big fish.
They get little <unk> because the <unk>
With the time they have a few fish but we think that's the point of <unk>
And the question is, why we do that?
Well, because we don't know that it was different.
In fact, many people, scientists, <unk> that was very different.
And it will be going to be going to be going to be going to take it because the evidence that is not the way that they would expect to have the evidence.
For example, the anecdote that some of the <unk> as a captain of a <unk> and maybe a lot of fish in this area can't be used or usually they can't use the scientists of the <unk> because it's not <unk>
So we have a situation where people don't know the past, although we live in clinical societies because they don't trust the sources of the past.
In there the huge paper that can be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to
Because with the <unk> areas we actually actually made the past.
<unk> the past people can't think about because the point of press has gone and it's extremely low.
That is for the people that you can see a private area, and you can benefit from the vision that we <unk> what you can allow them to erase your point of <unk>
And what happens to the people that you can't do it because they don't have access to the people of the <unk> for <unk>
I think there there and the arts and <unk> maybe you can fill the <unk> <unk>
This is a simulation of <unk> <unk>
It was a lot of time in the <unk> <unk> about 500 years.
And you have noticed that <unk> and <unk> are like <unk>
And if you think about <unk> if you think about what people were done with the movie <unk> talking about the story of <unk> why <unk> with the <unk>
Because it turns out something that, in a certain sense, it has changed.
And that's why my <unk> the only thing that we would <unk> is <unk> to make <unk> <unk> under the water.
Thank you very much.
Hi. I'm Kevin <unk> the <unk> <unk> <unk> and I look at YouTube YouTube in a professional way.
It's true.
So we're going to see why the videos are <unk> and what it has to do it.
We all want to be <unk> <unk> <unk> -- when I was more young, that seemed to be very hard.
But today, the white video makes any of us, or our <unk> <unk> in a part of our global culture.
Anybody can be famous in the Internet in a <unk>
They go over 48 hours of video for a minute.
And of course, just a small percentage of a small percentage is <unk> it takes a lot of <unk> and <unk> cultural <unk>
How is that?
Three things: I think of <unk> communities communities and a surprise.
Well, <unk>
<unk> <unk> Oh, my God, my mine.
My God!
Okay.
<unk> <unk>
KA: The year, <unk> <unk> published this video video outside his house in the National Park, of <unk>
In 2010, it was seen 23 million times.
This graph shows the <unk> in the rise of the end of the past time.
<unk> I didn't want to do a <unk>
I just wanted to share a <unk>
That's what you do if it's called the <unk> <unk> <unk>
I had published many videos of nature.
This video had published in January.
So what happened here?
It was <unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk> published this <unk> that <unk> the video of the <unk>
<unk> <unk> as <unk> <unk> and the <unk> things -- and the <unk> to a wider audience.
<unk> <unk>     You have to start <unk>    All you want to get the end of week, the end of week, the end of a week.    I don't think we can have this conversation without talking about this video, I can have to have this video <unk>
<unk> <unk> is one of the most popular videos of the year.
They saw almost 200 million times this year.
This graph shows the frequency of use.
At the same thing that <unk> <unk> this video seemed like to be <unk>
So what happened this day?
Well, it was <unk> it's true.
And if you ask them for those other <unk> they're also <unk>
But what happened this day, this day, this <unk>
Well, I took it <unk> and many blogs started writing about it.
Michael <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> was one of the first people to make a joke on Twitter.
But the important thing is that one person or a group of <unk> and a group of view, and they share them with a more <unk> public <unk> the process.
So this community of people who have the great joke that you have this big joke -- then you start to talk about that and do things.
And now there are 10 <unk> <unk> in YouTube.
As only in the first seven days, there was a kind of kind of kind of kind of one of the other days.
A difference of the 20th century in the 20th century is our way to be part of the <unk> phenomenon or doing something new with <unk>
<unk> <unk> is a <unk> animation with a <unk> music.
It's so that's it.
This year you saw about 50 million times.
And if you think that that is <unk> you know that there are a version of three hours that has seen four million times.
Until the mammals saw this video.
And there are mammals that saw other mammals see the video.
But the important thing here is the creativity that he took up between the <unk> community.
There was <unk>
Someone did a version of the old age.
And then they made the international <unk>
And suddenly it came up all a whole community of <unk> that made it this to be a <unk> joke to something that we can all be able to be.
Because today not only <unk>
Who could be something like this.
Who might be <unk> <unk> <unk> or <unk> <unk> or <unk> <unk>
What would you be written to be written that <unk>
In a world where you get two days of video for a minute, just that really only only one of the way that things have done.
When a friend told me that I had to see this great video of a kind of kind of <unk> <unk> in New York, I was not interested in a lot of a lot too much.
<unk> <unk> I was <unk> by the <unk> but often there are the obstacles that they buy them <unk> by <unk>
KA: Thank you to the surprise and her <unk> <unk> I had been five million watching and <unk> its idea.
That's why this approach is worth all the new thing that we make a creative way.
And all of this leads to a great question.
<unk> <unk> What does this mean?
<unk>
KA: What does this mean?
And the <unk> of <unk> creative communities are a <unk> of a new kind of media in a new culture of a new culture of a new culture, which we all have access and it's the audience that apply the <unk>
As I said before, one of the <unk> of the world, <unk> <unk> started in YouTube.
I don't get permission to express their ideas.
Now we all are a little set of our <unk> culture.
These are not the features of the old old things are just the brain of the media.
Thank you.
This is not a <unk> story.
It's a <unk> which is still <unk>
Let me tell you about some of the <unk>
Imagine the first <unk> a man set the work from a whole life.
It's a button, a <unk> one man whose whole life had been been <unk> in the hope and the one of their country.
<unk> as the <unk> come on <unk> <unk> the fact that their life had been entirely entirely in <unk>
The words, for so many time they have been <unk>
It is <unk> in the silence.
He said, <unk> for the story.
He is my grandfather.
I never met it.
But our lives are much more than our own.
My grandmother never allowed me to forget your story.
My task was not to leave that that has been in <unk> and my lesson was to learn that the story I tried to <unk> but the <unk>
The next part of the <unk> is about a boat at the <unk> <unk> <unk> to the sea.
My mother, <unk> I had just 18 years ago when his father died, and a <unk> <unk> and two girls and two girls and two girls and two girls and two girls and two girls and two women.
For it, the life was going to be going to a <unk> task and a new life.
It was <unk> for her who couldn't do it.
And then after a <unk> of four years that you challenge the fiction a boat on the sea <unk> <unk>
All of the adults knew the risks.
The ultimate fear was the <unk> and women.
As most of the adults, my mother had a <unk> with a <unk>
If we <unk> it was the first thing -- my sister and I, and then she and my grandmother.
My first memories are from that boat, the average rate of the <unk> the <unk> and the <unk> in every <unk> and the fact that we have been a lot of <unk>
I don't remember the teams that they came up several times, but they were just <unk> with the <unk> of men in our boat, or the engine dying and not just be able to run over six hours.
But I know I remember the lights of the <unk> platform in front of the <unk> and the young man who turned out and lost the journey was too much for it, and the first apple that I knew, just by the men of the platform.
No apple had after the same vulnerable
After three months in a <unk> field in <unk>
And the next piece of the <unk> is about four women at the long of three generations giving a new life.
We set up in <unk> a <unk> <unk> whose population is <unk>
Unlike the <unk> of the <unk> class whose existence was <unk> in <unk> no sense of the right.
<unk> that came from the <unk> were the rest of the world.
And the fragments of English <unk> <unk> between people who had a thing in common.
My mother worked in <unk> then in a <unk> line of cars, working six days, as much as a <unk>
I still found time to study English and get a title in <unk> <unk> <unk>
We were poor.
All of the dollars were <unk> and it was a extra <unk> in English and mathematics, not care what it was <unk> that usually was <unk> <unk> always was <unk>
Two pairs of <unk> to school, you have to hide the holes of the other.
A school for the <unk> because I had to last six years.
And there were very rare and <unk> about the <unk> <unk> and some <unk> <unk> <unk>
I said, <unk>
Something in me <unk>
I was <unk> <unk> and a voice that said, "I'm going to <unk>
My mother, my sister was <unk> in the same bed.
My mother was <unk> every night, but we <unk> about our day and <unk> the movements of our grandmother in the house.
My mother had <unk> all of the boat.
And my task was going to be <unk> until their <unk> would be able to be <unk>
She opened a shop of computers, then I studied it to be <unk> and opened up the other business.
And women came up with their stories about men who could not do the <unk> and <unk> and kids were missing two worlds.
They were killed and <unk>
And they came up and they were created together.
I lived in worlds.
In one, it was the student <unk> <unk> with what I would get out of myself.
In the other other, I was <unk> in the lives of <unk> <unk> <unk> by the violence of drugs and <unk>
But many of them have been helping them through the years.
And by that work, when I studied my last year of <unk> I took me the young age of the year.
And I went back from a piece of <unk> to the another, but their <unk> <unk>
As <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> was now because of the <unk> and the social activist and I took to talk about sites that had never heard about, and in houses whose existence had never ever imagined.
I didn't know the <unk>
I didn't know how to use the <unk>
I didn't know how to talk about wine.
I didn't know how to talk about anything.
I wanted to tell you the engineers and the life of life in a <unk> <unk> -- a grandmother, a mother and two daughters the day they did for almost 20 years old, <unk> on the day of each day and <unk> <unk> the three still in the same bed.
And I told my mother that I couldn't do it.
I thought I had now the same age that she had when we get the boat.
<unk> had been a choice.
<unk> told me <unk>
So I talked about <unk> <unk> and education and <unk> and <unk>
And the most amazing thing -- I was going to be <unk> to speak.
I met people from all of all the roads of life, many of them doing what they <unk> living in the border of it.
And although I ended up my <unk> I realized that I couldn't stay in a <unk>
I had to be another piece of the puzzle.
And I realized at the same time that it's good to be a <unk> a <unk> <unk> in the scene -- and not only that it's fine, but it's something that you will be <unk> perhaps a gift of the boat.
Because it can be inside it can be able to be able to be <unk> <unk> can be able to accept the <unk> of your <unk>
I gave the enough steps outside my life, to know that, yeah, that the world is <unk> but not the way we do.
<unk> who didn't have been <unk> were <unk> <unk>
There was a energy there, a <unk> <unk> a <unk> <unk> and <unk>
So I took my intuition.
<unk> to a small group of people for those who the <unk> can't <unk> it was a <unk> challenge <unk>
For a year we didn't have a <unk>
At the end of every day, I did a giant <unk> <unk> that all of the <unk>
<unk> until the night.
Most of our ideas were <unk> but some of them, and we grow it again.
I took the decision to get to the U.S.
After a only journey.
My <unk> again.
Three months later I had been <unk> and <unk>
Before <unk> let me tell you about my grandmother.
She grew up in a time where the <unk> was the social narrative and the local <unk> was the person that they were born.
Life had no changed for centuries.
Your father died before she was born.
The mother grew up alone.
I became a <unk> of a <unk> whose mother <unk>
Without the support of his husband, it took a <unk> to the <unk> and you take the cause it and much more <unk> it took when I did it.
You can't be able to be wrong.
I was in the <unk> in the room in a hotel hotel when she was sitting at one <unk> <unk>
I saw through the <unk> of the <unk> and I saw the end of the other side.
I knew I had come to <unk>
My mother named minutes later.
Forty days later, we went to a temple in <unk> and we sit around their <unk>
We've got stories and make sure that we were still with it.
On night a <unk> came and told us that I had to close the <unk>
My mother asked us to take your hand.
I asked the <unk> "Why your hand is hot, and the rest of the body is so <unk>
"Because you have taken his hand from the <unk> he said.
They don't have <unk>
If there are a nerve in our family that comes through women.
Because of those who we were and how the life is what life is now now we can see that men who have come to our lives to be <unk>
<unk> would be <unk>
Now I want to have my own kids, and I wonder about the boat.
Who could you want that to right?
However, I'm afraid to the privilege of the idea of the right.
I can give you a <unk> in their lives, a <unk> in each other, the <unk> rate of the star -- the vast rate that we don't mean anything?
I don't know.
But if you can give you and you can see it and you do it.
<unk> <unk> and also the mother of <unk> is today here, in the fourth or fifth of the <unk>
My story starts in <unk> about two years.
I was in the desert, under the sky <unk> with <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
We were having a lot of how nothing has changed from the age of the ancient <unk> <unk> "The <unk>
In those days, when the Indians wanted to travel <unk> to a car and <unk> the sky.
Now we do it with me.
In that time when I <unk> the great Grand <unk> I had been able to take a <unk> and with a <unk> on the ground, you see water.
Now we do the same with <unk> and machines.
The conclusion that we took was that the machine had been used to the magic.
And that was <unk>
Every time I felt a little bit more <unk>
I <unk> this idea of losing the ability to enjoy it, and I appreciate a <unk> if I didn't have the camera, if I couldn't get my friends.
It seemed to me that technology had to allow you to allow you <unk>
He was my grandfather asked me his <unk> <unk>
And this particular piece of 50 years was for my greatest thing.
It became a <unk> door to a full world of <unk> and <unk> in my imagination.
And I had a sense that you have a sense that the <unk> <unk> and the cameras are going to be <unk>
<unk> our inspiration.
So I took me to me, I took me to this technological world to see how to use it to create <unk> instead of <unk>
<unk> books from the 16 years.
So when I saw the shoulder, I saw a <unk> device able to connect to the <unk>
You can know how the book, we take the book, you can know how the book, you take the book, you can know how to take the book, you can know how to take the book, you can know how to take the book, you can know how we take the book, you can know how we take the book, you can know how we take the book, you can
What we are.
You take the text with the image, the <unk> the sound and you can.
<unk> becomes more <unk>
But, what do you do that?
I'm going to take it <unk> an interactive app for reverse.
He says, <unk> your fingers on each other.
And so,    He said, "This box is <unk> I write my name.
And so I took me a name of the book.
In several times I got a <unk> -- the <unk> knows where I live up because of the <unk> -- which comes to me.
My focus was excited about all these possibilities.
I've talked a lot of magic.
And I don't mean it and <unk> but to that magic of mine, to those ideas that are <unk>
For some reason, fireflies in an epidemic always told me to me.
So by here, we have to be able to be able to take the <unk> for the <unk>
And actually, you get your way to the way that the <unk>
Another idea that I was fascinated to me was that a whole galaxy is a <unk> in a <unk>
So here, every book and every book is involved in a <unk> that I would say to this <unk> device.
And this opens a map.
In all of the <unk> book has always been maps but they've been <unk>
This is a map that <unk> <unk> and they feed them for the rest of the book.
In certain points of the book also <unk>
Now I'm going to go around.
Another important thing for me is to create content and the time they come.
These are the <unk>
We've heard of the <unk> and the <unk> but how many people outside India know their <unk> <unk> <unk>
These poor <unk> have been <unk> in the cameras of the cameras in <unk> in a old and <unk>
So we're going to bring them back in a young story of <unk>
And in a story that this is issues like the financial crisis.
And talking about the environmental crisis, one of the problems of the last 10 years has been that children have been <unk> <unk> to their <unk> they haven't been <unk>
But now with human technology, we can take our kids to the natural world with its technology.
One of the interactions of the book is this <unk> where you have to go on the outside, you take the camera or <unk> and we collect images of different objects.
He had a lot of <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk>
For some reason the children don't do it.
So to make this way to recover this <unk> of the childhood you have to go out and in a <unk> <unk> a picture of a <unk> and then <unk>
In other women, you have to take a picture of a piece of cortex, and then <unk>
So this way it creates a digital collection of pictures that then you can put on the Web.
A kid in London put a picture of a <unk> and says, "Oh, I saw a <unk>
A boy of India says, "I saw a <unk>
And it creates this kind of social network around a collection of a digital pictures that have gone down.
In the way of the <unk> <unk> the Earth and technology is a lot of possibilities.
In the next book we have to have a interaction in which you come on with the <unk> and the video on and it can be able to see a group of <unk> <unk> that appear on the plants in the house.
In a moment the screen is full of <unk>
And you have to make the sound of the wind and <unk> to be able to read the rest of the book.
We are going to a world where the forces of nature are <unk> with the technology and the technology and technology is going to be going to another.
<unk> the energy of the sun.
We are <unk> to our children and all of the natural world and that <unk> and love and love and love to live through a simple story.
Thank you.
I'd like to tell you about why many projects of <unk> <unk>
And I believe, really, the most important thing that the most important thing that we leave to listen to patients.
And one of the things we did in the University of <unk> was <unk> to a director of listening.
And not in a very scientific way, she took a little cup of coffee or you and I asked patients, family and <unk> What <unk>
"How can we <unk>
And we tend to think, that this is one of the biggest problems that everybody, or maybe not all, but most of the projects.
This is my <unk> <unk>
It has a <unk> <unk>
All of the morning I <unk>
And yeah, I have a challenge as you can see.
I put me the challenge of being to 70 <unk>
But it is so simple, that every time I said, send me my information to Google <unk>
And my <unk> doctor has access to him as well. So he can see what my problem is my problem in the same moment in the same time that we need <unk> or a sense of that -- but you can see it.
But there's another thing.
As some of you know, I have more than four <unk> in Twitter.
So every morning I went to my <unk> <unk> and before you go to my car, people start <unk> <unk> today today I think you need a <unk>
That's the best thing that you can change that is pressure from the nation used to help patients because it could be used for obesity, and also for the patients let them stop <unk>
On the other hand, it can be <unk> to move to the people of their business, and together together to develop some <unk> activity to have more control of its health.
From next week.
This little <unk> connected to a iPhone, or another device.
And people come up from their homes, to take their pressure <unk> <unk> and share with each other, for example, for 100 dollars.
This is the point where the patients are going to get a <unk> they come to make the control and being <unk> of their own <unk> but we can also help us help care of health care because of the challenges that we face as the <unk> of the <unk>
<unk> techniques that are important to use and start with this to bring patients in the team.
And you can do it with techniques like this, but also through <unk>
And one of the things that we did want to share with you with a video with a video with a video with a video with a video with a video with a video with a video with a video with a video with a video with a video with a video with a video with a video with a video with a video with a video with a video
We all have <unk> <unk>
Maybe we even have in our phones.
We know perfectly where the <unk> <unk> in <unk>
Where are all the <unk>
And of course, we can find a lot of fast food.
But where the <unk> <unk> to help this <unk>
I mean, but no one <unk>
No one knew where you get the <unk> <unk> lives in this time.
And what we did was making it <unk> in the <unk>
We created a green website -- and we asked the public <unk> you see a <unk> please <unk> <unk> -- and when it is open because sometimes open on the <unk> of office and other are closed.
And more than 10 <unk> they had been in the <unk>
The next step was looking for the app for that.
And we did a app for the boat.
We created an app for <unk> reality to find these <unk>
And every time they are in the city of <unk> and somebody <unk> you can use their iPhone, and the weeks of weeks to use their cell cell cell phone to find the <unk> <unk> which can save lives.
And from today, I want to present this one, not only like <unk> <unk> which is the name of the product, but also as <unk>
And we're going to take it into the global level.
We are <unk> all of the colleagues in the world, in the world, to help us be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to
Every time they are <unk> and somebody <unk> it can be a <unk> or somebody in you, you can do it.
I also want to invite companies around the world that they could help help us have <unk>
They could be <unk> or people from <unk> for instance, to see if the <unk> that is still in the place.
Please <unk> in this and not only improve health, but to take the control of it.
Thank you very much.
I'm here to share <unk> picture.
Or it's <unk> <unk>
Because of course, these are pictures that you can't take with their cameras.
My interest for the photograph was inspired with my first digital camera at 15 years.
I put it with my passion before the <unk> but it was a little bit different because we use the camera on the <unk>
And when you take a photograph with a camera on the process of the process when it gets <unk> the <unk>
For me the photograph I had more to see with being in the right place in the right time.
He seemed to do it.
And so I wanted to create something different, a process that I started the <unk>
<unk> like this: a building in a very <unk>
But it has an amazing <unk>
And even though it takes a <unk>
Or pictures like <unk> <unk> and <unk> and the time of the common objective to keep the <unk>
And when I say, I say, I say <unk>
Because, of course, it's not something that I can <unk> but I always want you to be <unk> in some way as a picture.
<unk> where you have to think about a moment to discover the <unk>
It has more than seeing with capture a idea that with capture a time.
But what is the trick that makes it seem to happen.
They're the details or <unk>
I was going to be <unk>
What's what it creates the <unk>
Sometimes the illusion is the perspective.
But the end is about our way to interpret the world and how you can feel in a <unk> surface.
It's not not about if it's <unk> but what we think is <unk>
So I think the <unk> are very simple.
I see the one of the reality of the reality that we took different pieces of reality and we put them to create a global reality.
I'll show you a simple example.
Here we have three objects perfectly <unk> something that we all can do with the three-dimensional world.
But thirdly, in some way you can create something that it still seems to be <unk> as if they died.
But at the same time, we know that it doesn't exist.
And so <unk> the brain because the brain doesn't know the fact that that really doesn't have sense.
And I see the same process to combine the pictures.
It's really going to combine different <unk>
And the things that they make a look like a look like <unk> I think they're those in the ones that we don't even have the things that we live in our life.
But as we combine photographs is very important <unk> because of the other way you see bad.
So I'd like to say that there are three rules that are going to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to get to
As you can see, these images are not very special.
But <unk> can create something like this.
So the first rule is that the combination of pictures must have the same perspective.
Second, the pictures of <unk> must have the same kind of light.
And these two images with these <unk> they were taken to the same height and the same kind of light.
The third point is to make impossible to distinguish the beginning and the end of the different images with a perfect patient.
It has to be impossible to see where the picture.
This is another example.
I could think that this is the image of a landscape and the lower part is <unk>
But this picture is entirely about pictures of different places.
In the personal time, I think it's easier to create a place that we would be able to be able to put the ideas that has in the head.
But it requires a lot a lot of <unk>
And as I thought this idea in the winter knew that I had several months for <unk> to find the different places for the pieces of the puzzle.
For example, the fish was made in a journey, in a journey,
<unk> are a different way.
The <unk> part was a <unk> in a <unk>
And yeah, I even did the red house of the top of the island that it seems more <unk>
So to make a <unk> result I think you need to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able
It always start with a <unk> a idea.
Then you have to combine the different pictures.
And here every piece is very good <unk>
If you do a good job when you take the pictures of the result can be very beautiful and the time that is very beautiful and the time that is very beautiful and the time.
All the tools are there and the only limit is our imagination.
Thank you.
I will start showing you a slide about technology, very boring technology.
Please get <unk>
It's a diagram that I took from a painting of mine.
I'm not interested in so far to show you the details, but it looks like.
It's a analysis that we were doing about the power of the <unk> <unk> against the power of the local networks.
The interesting thing about this is that this is that this as a lot of other than we tend to see, it's a kind of straight line in scale.
In other words, every step of here is an order of magnitude in the scale scale.
I'm going to talk about technology with <unk> <unk>
Here is something amazing.
And what I'm going to talk about.
Please cut the lights.
<unk> <unk> because writing about paper.
Why do you make it <unk> in <unk> <unk>
The answer is that if the <unk> in a normal curve in which that, say, these are the years, or some of the time, and this would be any of the technology that I would like to <unk> the diagram you see something ridiculous.
It would be something like this.
It doesn't say a lot.
But if you look for example, for example, some other technology, like the <unk> in a <unk> <unk> it would be very excited to see a line.
But if it happens something like this, it gives it a <unk> change.
If the technology is <unk> as fast as the <unk> of <unk> and we could take a <unk> and being in Egypt, in 30 seconds.
But we don't go back to that.
There are no effective in the story of the technological development of a <unk> growth that every few years of the <unk> <unk>
The question that I want to ask is -- if you ask this -- you see these <unk> <unk> we see that they don't still get forever.
It's not possible to support this change as fast as it goes.
<unk> one of two things.
Or you can turn it in a typical <unk> I know like this until you get something completely different, or maybe I'll do something like that.
That's all that it can happen.
I'm why I think you might be going to happen something like that.
And so now we can be in the middle of a <unk>
In this line we are in a transition transition that used to be the world, a new way.
So what I try to ask, and ask me, is: what is that new way that we get to the world?
So what new has got the world?
The transition seems very, very <unk> if we are involved in it.
I remember that I remember the future on the year 2000 and people used to talk about what it was in the year 2000.
This is a conference where people talk about the future and we see that the future is still the year 2000.
That's all what we see.
In other words, the future is <unk> year after year, at the long of my life.
But I think it must feel something is going to happen.
It looks like a transformation.
And we know that it doesn't have a lot of sense to think about 30 or 50 years because it all will be so different that we think we're doing today not any sense.
So I want to tell you about how to be, how it could be that transition to <unk>
But so to do that to make a little bit of things that they don't have a lot of things that you have a lot of technology and <unk>
Because I think the only way to understand is taking distance and look at the whole things at the long term.
The scale of time I'd like to do it is the time of life on Earth.
I think this image has sense if we look at every billion years.
So we go back about a few hundred million years when the Earth was a big rock, with a lot of chemicals that would get around us.
If we look at the way that we were connected those chemicals we give us a idea of how the things.
And I think there are theories to start to understand the origin with <unk> I'm going to tell you a simple version of this and it's that, in that time, there was floating about <unk> oil with all kinds of <unk> chemicals in its inside.
Some of those departments of oil departments a particular combination of chemicals that they made them to be able to be able to bring the materials from the outside of the outside of the outside of the outside of the outside and <unk>
And they started <unk>
In a certain sense, those were the more <unk> cell phones that <unk> of oil.
But those of them were not in the present sense, because every one of them had a recipe of <unk>
And every time they <unk> <unk> a <unk> distribution of chemicals that <unk>
So every <unk> was a little bit different.
In fact, <unk> that some way is <unk> being better at the time of putting the chemicals -- <unk> <unk> more chemicals and <unk>
They lived more time, they were more <unk>
It was a way of life, a very simple life, but the things is really interesting when these <unk> learned the trick of <unk>
In some way we don't understand very well these <unk> they learned to build information.
They learned to save information, which was the recipe of the cell cell called DNA.
In other words, <unk> in this evolution without sense, a <unk> system that allowed them to be able to get <unk>
The amazing thing is that that is that that <unk> system seems to be <unk> since they have been a dozen billion years.
Our recipe our genes, have the same code, that same system.
In fact, every single being living is expressed with exactly the same set of letters and the same code.
And one of the things that I did just <unk> now we can write things with this code.
So here I have 100 <unk> of the white dust that I try to hide people from the <unk>
But <unk> I took this <unk> the code has the common letters that we tend to use in this -- and I wrote my personal data on this piece of DNA <unk> and <unk> 10 to the 22 times.
So if somebody wants to 100 million copies of my personal <unk> I have a lot of all the <unk> in fact, for every person of the world and it's here.
If it was a <unk> it would be put in a virus and it would be <unk> by the room.
What was the next <unk>
Knowing the DNA was a interesting thing.
This made these cells were happy about other billion years.
But then this is another big step on the things that things are very different and it was that these cells started to support and communicate information and communicate information to cells.
I don't know if you know, but bacteria can global DNA.
So for example, for instance, we have the resistance to the <unk>
Some bacteria found the way to avoid the <unk> and the <unk> to create their small DNA with other bacteria and now there are a lot of resistant to <unk> because the bacteria are.
And this communication gave them to get communities that in a certain way, they were together in it, and <unk> a <unk>
So that way <unk> or <unk> together, or you know, if a community was very successful all of the individuals of that community <unk> more and they were <unk> by evolution.
And the point of the point happened when these communities were taught so much that, in fact, they decided to write all the recipe of the <unk> community in a chain of DNA.
The next stage stage for life took other billion years.
And in that stage we have communities <unk> communities in many different types of different cells working together, as a only organism.
In fact, we are a <unk> community.
We have a lot of cells that you can't act in it.
The cell of the skin not even the heart of the heart, or the <unk> or the <unk>
So these communities evolved and the most interesting levels that the cell has we call a organism.
The next level happened within these communities.
These started <unk> information.
And to build very special structures that they didn't make more that we need information in community.
They're the <unk> structures.
The neurons are the <unk> that the information that those microbial communities.
In fact, they started <unk> within the community to be the <unk> structures of <unk> understanding and convey information.
Those were the brains and the nervous system of those communities.
And that gave them a real goal.
Because at that moment as we <unk> the learning was <unk> to the duration of a organism, and not the time of the time.
So a organism could be able to be able to be able to be able to eat some of the <unk> because I knew bad and it was walking up the last time that I do.
That could happen for the life of a organism because before they had built these data processing structures that for the evolution would have learned for hundreds of thousands of years for the death of individuals who get that <unk>
And so the fact that the fact that the nervous system build those structures of information that makes a lot of information that is a <unk> process.
Because the evolution could now happen to a individual.
It could happen in the time you need to learn.
But then, of course, individuals found the trick of the communication.
So for example, the most <unk> version that we know is the human language.
If we thought, it's an incredible object.
I have a very complicated idea a very complicated idea.
I'm sitting in <unk> a couple of <unk> and with lucky, building a very similar idea and <unk> in their heads that put some of the <unk>
But we take something very complicated that we become sound, in sound, and we produce something very complicated in the other brain.
That's now allowed us to start to work as a organism.
In fact, as humanity, we've started doing <unk>
And now we spend by the time as much as a <unk> organisms -- <unk> our methods of <unk> and information processing data.
For example, the invention of the language was a small step on that direction.
<unk> the <unk> the <unk> <unk> <unk> and so so they're the effective mechanisms that we now build to drive that information.
And that brings us into something much more big, faster and able to develop more than we did before.
Now the evolution can happen to happen.
You saw the evolutionary <unk> of <unk> in which it produced some evolution with the <unk> program.
And now we have <unk> the way of time again.
The first stages of the story that I told you took a billion years ago.
The next <unk> the nervous system and the brain, took about hundreds of millions of years.
<unk> language took less than a million years.
And the <unk> it seems to take only a few decades.
And the process is <unk> I guess <unk> is the right word to name something that we find, their own change change.
The more fast goes on it.
And I think that's what we look at this explosion of the <unk>
We see that the process is <unk>
But I give me the life designing computers and I know that the mechanisms that they can work for <unk> not be possible without the <unk>
But now now design objects that would be impossible for me to be impossible for me <unk>
I don't know that each of them in that machine machine.
There are thousands of million.
And instead of that, with the designers of <unk> <unk> we think about a <unk> level we put it on the machine and the machine that makes something that before you can't do it is much more far and faster than never before.
In fact, sometimes it used enough methods that we don't even understand it.
A particularly particularly interesting method that I've been using <unk> is the evolution itself.
We put within the machine a evolutionary process that works on the scale of the <unk>
And for example, in the most other cases in the other cases we can develop a program from a sequence sequence of a <unk> sequence of instructions.
We say, "You can run a hundred million of the <unk> <unk>
You could take these sequences of the instructions that we took all of those programs and take those <unk> and take those people that we want to do?"
In other words, I would do what I want.
So let's say I want to talk about numbers, to put a simple example.
So we found the programs that are going to give you numbers.
Of course, it's a little likely to be a little bit likely to be <unk> <unk> <unk> -- so any of them did it.
But one, luckily, it was going to get two numbers in the top of the right.
And I said, <unk> you could take 10 percent of those signs that better made the <unk>
<unk> those and <unk> the time.
And now you know, the best thing that better <unk> the numbers.
And let's go back to <unk> by the <unk> <unk> <unk>
Let's take two programs that <unk> kids, who <unk> <unk> and the children are <unk> the properties of both jobs.
So we get a new generation of programs that they had a little bit more than success.
And we say, "Please <unk> <unk>
<unk> again.
It was going to take some of a <unk>
And they try and <unk> with another generation.
Well, every generation is a few generation about a few years.
So I can make the equivalent of millions of years of evolution in a few minutes or in cases a few hours.
At the end, we ended up with programs that are going to be really perfect numbers.
In fact, they're a lot more efficient that I could have written to hand.
If I look at those programs I can't say how to work.
I've tried to take it to see how they work.
They are <unk> <unk>
But they get the <unk>
In fact, I know, I have the security of that you can get the goal because they come from a bloodline of hundreds of thousands of programs that they can.
In fact, their lives are going to get out of it.
One time I was in a <unk> with <unk> <unk> and they took me a card and says, "Look this.
He said, <unk> plane has hundreds of thousands of <unk> who work together to provide a <unk> flight -- you don't feel <unk>
We know that the engineering processes don't work very good when you get a lot of a lot of it when you get a lot of a lot of it.
So we start to depend on the computers to make the computers to make things very different.
And that allows us to produce a lot more complex things that make the normal engineering.
However, we don't understand all the choices that you are.
In that sense, it goes in front of us.
Now we use those programs to make computers much more enough and so we can run these programs a lot more quickly.
I mean, <unk>
The thing is getting faster and that I think it seems so <unk>
Because all these technologies are <unk>
We are <unk>
And we're in a moment to the <unk> organisms when they became <unk>
We are the <unk> and we can't understand what the Earth is <unk>
We are in the point.
But I think something comes behind us.
I think it would be very <unk> of our part to think that we're the end of evolution.
And I think all of us are part of the creation of what is that it is.
But now it comes to me, and I think let me stop here before I <unk>
I think we have to do something with a part of the medical culture that must change.
And I think this starts with a doctor, and that's me.
And I've been <unk> the enough for enough to ask me part of my false <unk>
Before I try to try the subject of my talk, we talk a little bit of <unk>
Why right?
We are close to the end of the end, the <unk>
We love the <unk> right?
<unk> is full of the amazing possibility.
There are hundreds of statistics.
It's going to get <unk> the <unk> talks about the statistics and they use them to form a great team of <unk>
I focus on one of them and I hope that many of you love it.
It's called average <unk>
And we talked about <unk> of a <unk> that <unk>
That means that the <unk> <unk> three of 10 times.
That means to take the ball into the field of game without being <unk> and anyone who are <unk> to the first <unk> not over time, and the second basis will be <unk>
three attempts to 10.
You know how you call a <unk> of 300 in the Great <unk>
Well, really well, maybe the team of stars.
You know how you call a <unk> <unk>
By the way, that's somebody who 10 <unk> <unk>
<unk> like the original <unk> <unk> the last player of the <unk> <unk> of <unk> in the age of the <unk> <unk>
Now I mean, this to my world of medicine where I feel much more <unk> or perhaps less likely to tell you today.
So let's imagine that they have <unk> and they're <unk> to a surgeon that has a <unk> <unk>
So it doesn't work, right?
Now suppose that live in a place of the <unk> and a really wanted to have two <unk> <unk> <unk> and their family from the family of the family -- which is <unk> in <unk>
But you know anything?
She's a little bit about this year.
They have been <unk>
This is not working.
But I ask them to ask them.
What do you think of you that you can be the average <unk> of a heart attack, or <unk> from a <unk> or <unk> <unk>
A very well.
And the truth of the matter is that nobody in all medicine knows the <unk> of a good <unk> or <unk>
What we do that, without the world in the world, and I was -- with <unk>
And that I had been able to be able to get a mistake and <unk> to figure out how to do it well.
That was the message that <unk> when I was in the school school in medicine.
I was a graduate student <unk>
One time, a fellow in the high school said that Brian <unk> studied until a <unk>
Maybe you know?
<unk> in my small <unk> in the middle of the <unk> <unk> <unk> not far from here.
And I learned about memory.
In my <unk> class of <unk> the origin and work on the <unk> of every job that comes from the <unk> the <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk>
And even I knew <unk> <unk> about how <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
And as many more knowledge and more knowledge.
And I was very <unk> I graduated with <unk>
And <unk> of the medicine of medicine with the impression that if you get all of all, then you know everything, or the more possible, close to all of all, because so I'm going to get me from mistakes.
And I worked for a time, until I met the lady <unk>
I was <unk> in a hospital at a college hospital here, when they brought the lady <unk> to the <unk> service where I was born.
In the time I took me to the <unk>
And when I <unk> I was going to ask a <unk> I was going to go to that patient to that patient
And we sell the head of <unk>
When I saw the lady <unk> I was <unk>
I heard a <unk> sound <unk>
And when the <unk> I heard a <unk> sound in both hand, what they gave me a <unk> <unk>
In these conditions in the heart of the heart of the <unk> and instead of <unk> the blood and the blood is going to go back and the blood goes on and so that there are difficulty to breathe.
And it wasn't hard to <unk>
I did it, and I put me to work in the treatment that they <unk>
I gave them <unk> and <unk> to provide the pressure in your heart.
And I gave them <unk> <unk> of water, so that I could take it <unk>
And in an hour or two, she started feel better.
And I felt very well.
And there was when I made the first <unk> the sent to his house.
In fact, it made two mistakes more.
The sent to his house without talking about the head of <unk>
I didn't have the phone -- I didn't do what I was going to be done, I was called my head and <unk> with him for him for the <unk>
And if my head would have seen you -- I would have been able to bring information <unk>
Maybe I did a good thing.
Maybe I didn't want to be a <unk> which is <unk> <unk>
Maybe I wanted to be so successful and able to take <unk> that could take care of my patients without even <unk>
The second mistake that I made was worse.
At the <unk> your house, I didn't know a voice to a voice in my inside which I said, <unk> is not a good idea.
In fact, I was so excited that until I asked them to the <unk> that <unk> the <unk> <unk> <unk> which is good if it's going to get your <unk>
And the nurse thought and then he told them with total <unk> I mean, I think I will be <unk>
I remember that as if it was yesterday.
And so I sold the <unk> and the <unk> along with the <unk> they took her home.
And I went back to the living room.
The rest of that day, that afternoon, I had a bad <unk> in the stomach, in the stomach,
But I grew up with my work.
At the end of the day, <unk> to leave the hospital and walked into the wall where I was my car to go home.
I spent by the <unk> service to home.
And there is another <unk> not the <unk> of the lady -- <unk> before, but one of me told me three words, those three words that most the most of the entire medical school doctors are.
Other penguins know it, but there are a <unk> in <unk> and it's that we see the patients <unk>
The three words is <unk>
I remember the patient who sent their <unk>
I asked the other <unk> <unk>
So she <unk> with the same circle.
She was okay.
But I went back and at the edge of women.
At a time of one time of one time of having the house, after I was going to give you the man, he had a <unk> and his family called the <unk> the <unk> the <unk> the <unk> the <unk> the <unk> the <unk> of <unk> which means a <unk>
I was just <unk> and I was blue.
And the public <unk> all their resources.
They gave them to bring the blood pressure,
And they put them a artificial <unk>
I was <unk> and <unk> to the <unk>
I had a little bit of feelings because after the <unk> was in <unk> therapy, and I used to all hope that they were <unk>
And in the two or three days and three days was clear that never <unk>
It had a brain damage <unk>
The family came on.
And in eight or nine days, the <unk> what I was happening.
And at the front day, the left came to go. He said, wife, mother and grandmother.
They say you never forget the names of the ones that they die.
That was my first experience.
The weeks ago, I was going to be <unk> by that and I found it for the first time the <unk> shame that exists in our medical culture, and I felt <unk> <unk> <unk> without feel that shame because you can't take them with your colleagues.
You do the <unk> and they will never take that mistake.
It's that shame that leaves a <unk>
<unk> <unk> that I talk about is what makes us feel very bad for it.
It's what it tells us not that what we did was <unk> but we are bad.
And that <unk>
And it wasn't my <unk> he was a <unk>
I talked about the family and I'm sure that I would get the things and they thought I didn't get to me.
And I grew up with those questions.
Why didn't I asked my <unk> why the sent to its home?
And in my worst <unk> why did it made a mistake so <unk>
Why did I choose <unk>
I took a little bit of that feeling was <unk>
And I began to feel better.
And in a day <unk> the sky opened the sky and eventually went to me if I feel better again.
And I did a deal with me in which if you <unk> the efforts to be perfect to be a perfect way to be a perfect way to do it <unk>
And so it goes.
I went to work.
But it turned to happen.
Two years later, I was <unk> in the emergency department in a hospital in a hospital in the south of Bob and I received a man of 25 years with a pain in the <unk>
I was very busy and <unk>
And he went here.
I looked at her <unk> I was a little <unk>
I was <unk> and he sent them to his house.
But as he went to the door I had been <unk> her <unk>
Two days later, when I came to do my <unk> change my church asked me to talk about me in his office.
And I got the three words, you think of it.
Remember the patient who saw for a pain in the <unk>
Well, he came back and I didn't have a <unk> <unk>
I had a kind of potentially potentially <unk> called <unk>
You can be able to write it on Google. It's an memory, not the <unk> but of the <unk> and that you can cause the illusion of those side.
I said, luckily, I didn't know.
And they were <unk> antibiotics by the <unk> and it comes to the few days.
And I went on the same period of shame and <unk> and I went back to work, until it happened and again and again.
Two times in the same <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
And it's a great <unk> especially working in a hospital, because they were <unk> 14 patients at the same time.
But in both cases, I didn't have sent home to home and I don't think it's a <unk>
One of them thought I had a <unk> <unk>
<unk> one of the <unk> but it turned up normal a colleague who was putting up to the patient <unk> a certain sensitivity in the upper upper right and called the <unk>
The other patient was with a lot of diarrhea.
I took this <unk> for <unk> and I asked my colleague that I was <unk>
I went on, and you notice some <unk> on the lower upper way, called the <unk>
They both were <unk> and they get it very well.
But every single case is <unk>
But I'd like to tell you that I made the worst mistakes in the first five years of exercise and as many colleagues say, it's a <unk>
The most creative they've been for the last five years.
<unk> <unk> <unk>
And here's the problem: if I can't take them and talk about my mistakes, if I can't find the <unk> that I say what is going to be able to share this with my <unk>
How do you tell you this for the same <unk>
If I start now to a place like this, I had no idea that you think of me.
When it was the last time you hear somebody talking about <unk> after <unk> after <unk>
Of course in a <unk> <unk> talk about the mistakes of other doctors, but you don't hear somebody talking about their own mistakes.
And if I knew and my colleagues know and my colleagues know that a <unk> in my hospital <unk> the wrong leg and you have to need you need to need you need to need you to get them on to the eyes.
This is the system that we have.
The total <unk> of mistakes.
It's the system that there are two <unk> which you make mistakes and the ones that they don't know the ones that they can't sleep and the ones that you know that they have <unk> results.
And it's almost like a <unk> reaction like <unk> that you start to attack that person.
We have the idea that if you get out of the medicine to the people who make them without the people that they can help us have a safe system.
But that brings two problems.
In 20 years about the <unk> and Uganda, I have done a personal study of bad life, and mistakes to learn how possible, from the first article that I wrote to learn how possible, from the first article that I wrote for the <unk> <unk>
And what I learned is that the mistakes are <unk>
We worked in a system where the mistakes are all the days, where one of every 10 drugs in the hospital are <unk> or the <unk> is not right in a system where the <unk> infections are getting more and more <unk> and more <unk> and more <unk> and more <unk> and more <unk> and <unk> and <unk>
In this country, they die in this country, they die in 24 <unk> for mistakes to <unk>
The National Institute of the United States was created 100 dollars.
In both cases, it's <unk> <unk> because we're not <unk> the problem as we need.
And so they're things.
A <unk> system where the knowledge is taking every two or three or three years ago, and we don't get it.
<unk> <unk> <unk>
And we can't get out of it.
So we have the dynamic things that allow to make a perfect experience of a patient with pain in the desk.
Now, let's take the same patient with a pain in the chest, it comes up with <unk> eyes and <unk> and <unk> and suddenly my story was <unk> of 1900, and <unk>
It's not the same story.
I'm not a <unk> I don't do the things the same.
And my patients are not cars. I don't get their symptoms always the same way.
All of all, the mistakes are <unk>
So if we take the system as we <unk> and we took all the <unk> and we take them to all of the <unk> -- well, you don't have no all.
And what people don't want to talk about the more <unk>
In my <unk> <unk> <unk> art -- it's already a <unk> say, "This is my worst <unk> I would say all of all, from the <unk> until the head of surgery <unk> "This is my <unk> and <unk> the microphone to them.
And their students are <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> and they would start to tell their stories.
They want to tell their stories, they want to share them.
<unk> could say, "Look, you don't get the same <unk>
They need a context where we can do it.
They need an medical culture.
And it starts with a physician every time.
The medical doctor is human, and you know the human, and they don't care about their disability, but it doesn't be able to learn about what happened to teach others.
<unk> their experiences with them.
It's support for those who talk about their mistakes.
<unk> the mistakes of other people not with the intention of <unk> but in a way that they had all <unk>
And this works in a medical culture that suggests that human beings, and when this happens, they get mistakes rather than a time.
My name is Brian <unk>
I am a <unk> physician one.
I'm human <unk>
And I feel a lot of it, but I feel like to learn something that you can convey others.
I don't know what to me, but I can live with it.
And let me conclude with three words <unk> I remember it.
Do you know how many decisions we took a day.
Do you know how much we choose in a week?
I did a survey over 2,000 people and the amount of choices that says to choose a half American American is about 70 of the day.
It doesn't do a lot in an research research for a week to a group of <unk>
The researchers sold the different tasks of these <unk> and the time that we were able to take decisions to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able
They found that, in average, <unk> <unk> jobs for week.
Now, each work every job is a lot of <unk>
The half of those decisions took nine minutes or less.
Only one of the <unk> one time or more than the time.
Now think about their wars.
Do you know how many it comes to the category of nine minutes, and how many of a <unk>
How do you take the way that they do that <unk>
I want to talk about one of the biggest problems of the <unk> to choose to <unk>
I want to talk about the problem and a lot of a lot of solutions.
As I talk about this I'm going to ask you a few questions and I need to know their answers.
When you do a question, like I am like, raise your hand only if you want to do a <unk>
On another way, when you make a question, if you do a question, if your answer is <unk> please give a <unk>
And now my first question of the end, they're ready to hear about the problem of the <unk> problem.
Thank you.
At the late student student in the University of <unk> <unk> this <unk> of the very, very <unk> level at least in that time.
It's called <unk>
It was almost like to go to a <unk>
There were a few different different kinds of mustard and <unk> more than 500 different types of fruits and vegetables and about 25 percent of water <unk> and this was when we take water water from the <unk>
I loved that <unk> but in a occasion, I asked me why I would never get anything?
This is the <unk> <unk>
They had more than 75 different different different different different different different <unk>
One time I decided to visit the office and I asked him, <unk> this is this <unk> that all these <unk>
He showed me the <unk> <unk> that they were all the days, often with their cameras.
We decided to make a small experiment with <unk> This is the <unk>

They had a lot of different kinds of different.
<unk> a place for <unk> right at the entrance <unk>
And we put there of six <unk> or a different invitation and we see two things: First of all, what people were willing to go back to <unk> <unk>
More people to stop when there was a <unk> that when there was only six, a <unk>
We can also look at what we were more likely to buy a <unk> <unk>
So here's the opposite.
And what they stopped when I had <unk> only three came to buy <unk>
And what I came up when there was six, we saw that 30 30 years ago.
If we do the <unk> people had six times more probability to buy <unk> if they were discovered that if they were used to be <unk>
Well, they decide that we didn't buy <unk> you probably have <unk> <unk> <unk> is a good thing to preserve the <unk> but it turns out that the problem of the choices of choices affects us to <unk> <unk>
We decided not to save them even when this is not the <unk>
Now the subject of the end of the <unk>
I'm going to ask you a study that I did with <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> where we look at the decisions about a million gallons of the <unk> of a million gallons of the <unk>
We were interested in looking at if the number of economic industry is available in <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> people to save the future.
And we found that I really had a <unk>
We had a lot of people who were going from two, until the different choices of it.
We found that the biggest thing was the number of <unk> <unk>
So if we look at the <unk> we see that in the plans that provide two <unk> the death rate of 70 percent or more, not as high as well.
And in the plans that we took about 60 <unk> the rate of participation -- the death rate went on the <unk>
It turns out that even if you decide to be able to decide when there are more options even in that case, there are no consequences.
So for the ones that they decided to be <unk> the number of the most people -- more people are going to be able to avoid the actions or the <unk> <unk>
In the way there were more efficient they were more willing to invest in the market of the market.
But any of these decisions are the ones that we were <unk> to optimize the public well-being of the future.
In the 1970s, we've seen three huge consequences.
The most likely is that we get the choice that the <unk> is still when this is going on against the own.
It's more likely to take the worst <unk> in <unk> and health.
They're more likely to choose to pick things less <unk> even though they are going to be better.
The main reason is that we were going to look at that variety of <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> but we're not able to make the <unk> to be able to be able to be able to be able to make the calculations for the <unk> and pick out of that wonderful, <unk>
I want to take these four techniques that we have <unk> from a way or another, in different research, so that they can be able to make their business.
The first is, <unk>
You have heard before, but never been more than today, that less is more.
People are always connected when I say, <unk>
They're worried about to lose space in the <unk>
But we're actually seeing what we're seeing every time more is that if you decides you get out of <unk> choices there will be a increase in <unk> <unk> there will be a better experience in the choice.
When I <unk> <unk> <unk> spent in 26 different different types of <unk> <unk> <unk> in 2004, you saw a rise of 10 percent in it.
When we have <unk> <unk> <unk> the products for the <unk> <unk> which is less <unk> the <unk> in <unk> by the two <unk> and under the two <unk>
You know that the <unk> of today, in average provide 45 products.
In a <unk> <unk> <unk> about 100 products.
But the greatest store in the world in the world is <unk> and gives it only <unk> <unk> a kind of <unk> <unk>
In the world of the <unk> and I think one of the best examples that have come on about how to drive better choices is the <unk> of David <unk> the program.
All of the death of Harvard are <unk> automatically automatically automatically automatically automatically automatically come into a real background of life.
People who really want to be <unk> you give them 20 or more.
You know that often people say, "I don't know like <unk>
They're all <unk>
The first thing that I do is ask the <unk> <unk> the differences that there are between those options.
And if your employees can't <unk> you can't make their <unk>
And this afternoon, before I start this case, I was talking about <unk>
He told me that it would be willing to offer the people of this audience with all of them with all the most beautiful road in the world.
Here, a <unk>
I want you to do it.
I'm going to leave a few seconds to <unk> and then I want you to give you a hand if they're ready to take the <unk> of <unk>
<unk> <unk> Okay. Anybody who is ready to accept the way.
They're not more.
Well, I'm going to show you something more.
You knew there was a <unk>
Who is ready for that <unk>
I think I was going to hear more hands.
All right.
In fact, you have more information in the first <unk> that in the time, but I can be able to say that they thought the second time was more real.
Because the images made it more real.
This brings me to the second technique to drive the problem of the <unk> problem, which is <unk>
For people to understand the differences between choices have to understand the consequences of every choice, and the consequences must feel very much very <unk>
Why people spend 15 percent of 30 years in the average time when it uses <unk> <unk> <unk>
Because it doesn't really seem real money.
It turns out to make it more real, it can be a very positive tool for people to do more.
So we did a study with <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> about <unk> <unk> who worked in <unk> these people were in a meeting in the <unk>
At that meeting, that <unk> exactly as <unk> we did a little <unk>
What we found was that we were going to get to the personal things that you think in the other things that <unk> in their lives if they were more money.
With this <unk> there was a increase in the <unk> of 20 and a increase in the amount that they were interested in save or in what they wanted to put in their <unk> <unk>
The third technique is <unk>
We can be able to be able to make more <unk>
For example, this is a study that we did in a <unk> <unk>
We saw that in the <unk> <unk> at the bottom of the <unk> the exhibition of business, can contain from <unk> different types to <unk>
But you know?
Because the <unk> tells me how to <unk>
These are two <unk>
One is called <unk> and the other one.
If you think of the left is <unk> and the side of the right-hand is <unk> give a <unk>
<unk> <unk> Well, there's a couple of one.
If you think of the left is <unk> and the side of the right-hand is <unk> give a <unk>
Well, something more.
It turns out that is right.
The left is <unk> and the side of the right-hand is <unk> but you know anything?
This is absolutely <unk>
<unk> need to be something that they <unk> not the <unk>
They often see this problem with these huge <unk>
You know, who are <unk>
My fourth <unk> <unk> complexity.
It turns out that we can drive a lot more information that we thought, if you just get the <unk> a little bit.
We have to increase the complexity.
I'm going to show you an example of what I want to say.
Let's look at a good decision <unk> the buy a car.
This is a black <unk> <unk> that lets <unk> <unk>
You have to take 60 decisions, to build the car.
And these decisions associated in the number of choices that offers each one.
<unk> color outside the car.
<unk> box of <unk> four options.
What I'm going to do is we change the order that you see the decisions.
And so half of the clients are going to go from a lot of choices in a lot of mammals and a few of them, four <unk>
The other half of the clients are going to go from a few options four <unk> and a lot of options.
And what I'm going to <unk>
What are we going to go.
If you <unk> it always the button for the <unk> this shows that they're <unk> or <unk> we're <unk>
We found that the ones that are all of a lot of choices to <unk> <unk> the button and again, and again.
<unk>
If you go from a few choices in many, many choices they keep there.
The same information, the same number of options.
The only thing that I did was to change the order that it takes information.
If we started with the easy, you learn to <unk>
If you choose the box of changes you don't say anything about the preferences of the <unk> <unk> in all ways to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to
We talk about a product that we're building that now has more <unk> with the process.
<unk>
I've talked about four techniques to find the problem of the <unk> of <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> -- we can be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to
All these kinds of techniques that I've gone up were designed to help us to help support the <unk> or better, for you to use them in their <unk> or for the people who go on.
It's that I think the key to get the best of a choice is being <unk> to <unk>
And the most important thing we are in our best choices we can use the <unk> art.
Thank you very much.
In the <unk> <unk> in the front of the <unk> <unk> if you had a little bit of write to write to the government.
I had to get a piece of <unk> <unk> with the machine.
And this for the government could go back the origin of <unk>
If they found a written with the wrong message they could go back to the origin of the idea.
In the West, we don't think that somebody could do this, how much this is the freedom of <unk>
We never do that in our countries.
But today, in 2011, if you buy a giant printer of any big <unk> of any big <unk> -- that page will just end up with a bunch of black dots in every page that we have a pattern that makes you a pattern that makes you and their printer.
That's happening today.
And nobody seems <unk> a lot of this.
This is an example of the ways that our governments use technology in against us, citizens.
And it's one of the three main causes of problems in the network.
If we see what happens in the world in the line of the line of the line we can <unk> the <unk>
There are three different groups.
They're the <unk>
So Mr. <unk> <unk> of the city of <unk> in <unk>
<unk> <unk> is very easy to understand.
These guys make money.
They use them to win a lot of money, full of it.
There is a lot of many cases of <unk> in line, <unk> that <unk> money with their life.
This is <unk> <unk> <unk>
This is <unk> <unk>
This is Stephen <unk>
This is <unk> <unk>
These are <unk> <unk> <unk> and so forth.
These guys make their <unk> in the line but they make it by the whole media through <unk> <unk> to prevent money from our car, when you buy them in <unk> or <unk> our key information to get information in a computer <unk>
The secret of the United States is two months ago -- you know, <unk> <unk> <unk> and this realized had <unk> million dollars when it was <unk>
Mr. <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
And I say that today is more likely than any of us is a <unk> of a <unk> that a real crime.
And it's very obvious that this is wrong in the same.
In the future, most of the crimes of <unk> crimes in line.
The second group of <unk> in importance that we see today in day is not willing for money.
There are another thing that the <unk> would give them the <unk> they give them the <unk> <unk> <unk>
<unk> as <unk> have <unk> in the past 12 months ago, a paper on the <unk>
Those are the three <unk> <unk> the criminals who make it for money, the <unk> as <unk> that they do for us and the last group are the United States are the United States are the United group of the U.S.
And then we see cases like the <unk>
That's a good example of heart attack, against their own citizens.
<unk> is an authority of the <unk> or actually, it was it.
<unk> the last <unk> because of a <unk>
<unk> the security of the site and <unk> a <unk>
Last week said, I asked him in a meeting meeting of the government <unk> I asked them to one of the leaders if you <unk> <unk> the death of people to cause the <unk>
And the answer of him was yes.
So how do people get from a heart attack.
<unk> is a <unk> authority here.
<unk> <unk>
So what are the <unk>
Well, you need if you have a website with <unk> services, <unk> services like <unk>
Except, that <unk> an authority <unk>
And they took <unk> <unk>
And in the case of <unk> it happened.
And what happened in the Arab world and those things that have done for example, in <unk>
Well, in Egypt the <unk> <unk> the meat of the police police in 2012, and during the <unk> of the building, they found a lot of <unk>
Between those books, I was here called <unk>
And within that 2012, there were notes from a company in Germany who had been sold the real government tools to use a big scale of the citizens in the country.
They had been sold this tool for <unk> <unk> <unk>
<unk> is right here.
I mean, the government government takes them tools to make the governments to do this to their citizens.
But government government are also doing this to themselves.
For example, in Germany, it makes only a couple of weeks ago I found the <unk> <unk> a <unk> used by the U.S. government <unk>
If you get <unk> in a case <unk> well, it's pretty obvious that your phone is <unk>
But today it's more there.
It is <unk> the connection to the Internet.
<unk> even tools like the <unk> <unk> to interpret our computer with a <unk> to allow them to see all the communication, and listen to all the communication, and to get our data.
When we think about things like these the obvious response should be like, it seems very bad -- but I actually don't care because I'm a <unk>
Why do you do?"
I don't have nothing to <unk>
And that argument it doesn't have sense.
It's in play.
<unk> not <unk>
It's not a matter of privacy against security.
It's about the freedom against control.
If we could be aware of our government today today in 2011, any right that we are today, today, being forever.
<unk> <unk> in the future, in a flag that we could have within 50 years?
These are the questions that we need to worry about the next 50 years.
Here is where I live in Kenya, in Kenya, in the southern part of the <unk> <unk>
So these are the cows of my head at the bottom, and behind the <unk> the National Park, <unk>
The National Park, it has no <unk> in the highest part of the south, which means that we are the <unk> animals like the <unk> <unk> outside the park.
And here's the <unk> <unk> and this is what they do.
<unk> our <unk>
This is one of the ones who killed over night, and so soon we took us on the morning and we found them very bad because it was the only <unk> that we have a <unk>
My community, the <unk> we think that we came from the sky with our animals and all the land for <unk> and why the value of it.
So I grew up <unk> a lot of <unk>
Kids are <unk> that they protect our community and the <unk> and also they're also <unk> with the problem.
So kill you.
This is one of the six lions that they killed in <unk>
I think about this is just so few in the National Park, <unk>
A boy in my community, of six to the nine years, it's responsible for the won of his father and this was the same thing that I was going to me.
So I had to find a way to solve this problem.
My first idea was to be able to use it, because I thought the lions would give me fear.
But I realized that this is not <unk> because they even stopped the lions to see the <unk>
I didn't get me <unk>
A second idea was to use a <unk>
I was trying to trick the lions for the <unk> that I was about the <unk>
But the lions are very smart --  They came to the first day and they saw the <unk> and they looked at it, but the second day, they came up and they said, "This thing is not going to sit up here.
So one night I was walking around the <unk> with a <unk> and that day the lions didn't come away.
I found that the lions they have fear that it is.
So I had a idea.
And I got a test with the <unk> and the lights.
And this is a small lamp of a <unk>
<unk> everything.
As you can see, the solar cell cells and the <unk> <unk> the electricity to the small box -- I call it a difference?
And the <unk> box makes the lights <unk>
As you can see, the <unk> give them up because that's where they come from the <unk>
And that's how you see the lions when they come from night.
The lights <unk> and <unk> the lions to think that I'm walking by the <unk> but I'm going to get me on my bed.
Thank you.
So I put them on my house two years ago and since then, we never went to have problems with the <unk>
And the houses came on the idea.
One of them is about this grandmother.
He had killed many animals the lions and asked me if I could put the lights.
I said I know.
You can see the bottom, these are the lights to <unk>
Since then, I've been born in seven houses in my community and they're <unk>
And my idea is also used now for all Kenya, to provide other <unk> as <unk> <unk> and also it's also using it for the <unk> of <unk>
Thank this <unk> I had the fortune to get a <unk> in one of the best schools of Kenya, <unk> <unk> and I'm very excited.
My new school now is helping to raise <unk> and <unk>
I also took my friends to my community and <unk> lights in the houses that they don't have them, and I teach them how to <unk>
So a year ago, I was just a kid in the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> the cows of my father, and I used to see it that some day would be within one.
And here's here here.
I took the opportunity to come in plane for the first time to TED.
My great dream is to get to be an engineer, and the pilot when you go back.
I used to ask the <unk> but now as my invention is to save cows from my father and <unk> we can be with the lions without any conflict.
<unk> <unk> what in my language means a lot of much.
Chris Anderson: You don't picture the exciting thing that it's hearing a story like you.
So you have a <unk> Richard <unk> Yes.
CA: You're working on some extra <unk>
What is the next in your <unk>
<unk> My next invention is -- I want to do a little bit of <unk> CA:
<unk> I know that they had been invented the <unk> <unk> but I want to do my mine.
CA: You know, the <unk> once <unk> and <unk> <unk> I've tried before, but I got a <unk>  CA:    <unk> foot <unk> you're something big.
We're going to be <unk> in every step that <unk> friend mine.
Thank you very much.
When I was small, I thought my country was the best of the planet.
And I grew up singing a song called no <unk>
And I felt very hard.
In school, we did all of the time studying the story of <unk> <unk> but we never learned a lot of the rest of the world, except the United Nations North Korea are <unk>
Although I wonder about the rest of the world, I thought it was all my life in North Korea, until everything changed it changed <unk>
When I had seven years old, I saw my first public <unk>
But I thought my life in North Korea was normal.
My family was not poor and I had never gone sick.
But one day, in 1995, my mother brought home a letter from the colleague of my mom.
I said, "When you know, the five members of the family will be able to be in this world, because we haven't been thrilled in the two weeks ago.
We are <unk> together in the floor, and our bodies are so excited that we're ready to die."
I was very <unk>
It was the first time that people were suffering in my country.
As a little time, when I walked up in front of the <unk> station, I saw something terrible that I can't buy my memory.
A woman without life was dead in the street, sent a child <unk> in their arms looking at the face of his mother without able to do anything.
No one of the <unk> because they were very concerned about taking them and their families.
A huge <unk> <unk> North Korea to the <unk>
At the end of a million <unk> died for the 2030, and just just a few people eating and eating the insects and <unk>
They also made more and more <unk> and the <unk> of energy, all of my country was completely <unk> in the night except by the lights of the sea of the sea of the sea of my house.
I asked me why they had light and we don't.
This is a <unk> picture of North Korea in the night compared to the United States.
This is the <unk> <unk> which is the <unk> between North Korea and China.
As you can see, the river can be very <unk> in certain ways, to try to go back to <unk>
But many of them.
Sometimes I saw bodies in the city.
I can't reveal the details of how I left from North Korea, but I just can just say that for the years of <unk> I went back to China to live <unk>
But I just thought it would be <unk> of my family for short time.
I would never have a result that would take 14 years to live together.
In China, it was hard to live as a young woman without my family.
I had no idea how the life would be the life as <unk>
But I suddenly learned that it's not just extremely hard, but also dangerous, because the refugees are, in China were considered <unk>
So I was living with a constant fear that my identity was <unk> and it would be <unk> to a horrible destiny in North North Carolina.
One of the <unk> my worst <unk> was made it really when I went out for the Chinese police and <unk> me on the police.
Someone was told me to be <unk> then <unk> my skills in the Chinese language, and they did a lot of questions.
I was <unk>
I thought my heart was going to be <unk>
If it didn't seem natural it could be incarcerated and <unk>
I thought my life was going to <unk>
But I got to control my emotions and show questions.
At the end of the <unk> a police said to another, "This was a <unk>
And I left me to go.
Some of them in China are <unk> <unk> <unk>
But many of you can be <unk> by the Chinese police and <unk>
These women had a lot of luck.
Although the <unk> <unk> were finally cut up after an international pressure rate.
These are not so much lucky.
Every year, these are <unk> in China and <unk> in North Korea, where they're <unk> sharks or <unk> in public.
Although I was lucky in <unk> many other <unk> haven't got so much luck.
It's wonderful.
Even after learning a new language and find work, all its world can be <unk> in a second.
It's why after 10 years to hide my identity, I've decided to go back to North Korea, I decided to go to North Korea,
And I started a new life again.
<unk> in North Korea was a much greater challenge of what I was born.
The English was very important in Korea, I had to start learning my third language.
Also, I understood that there was a big gap between North and leaders.
We are all <unk> but by where we have come to be very different because of <unk> <unk>
I even went to a <unk> crisis.
I'm <unk> or <unk>
Where do I know what I mean, you know.
As soon, there was no country that I could call with pride to me.
If you go back to the life in North Korea, it wasn't easy, I did a plan. I started studying for the <unk> <unk>
Right when I started <unk> to my new life, I got a call <unk>
The authorities from North Korea, something of money who sent to my family, and as the <unk> my family was going to be <unk> to the force to a location in the <unk>
They had to get a lot of <unk>
And so I started to plan how to help me it.
<unk> have to travel a long way on the way to freedom.
It's almost impossible to cross the border between North Korea and North Korea,
So we took a flight to China and <unk> me to the border of North Carolina.
So my family couldn't talk about Chinese, I had to be <unk> in some of three miles through China and then through Asia.
The journey in <unk> took a week and almost we lost a few times.
One time, our bus was stopped and <unk> by a police <unk>
He went back to all of all, and they started asking you questions.
As my family couldn't understand Chinese, I thought my family was going to be <unk>
When the Chinese officer went back to my family, <unk> I put me and I told me that they were <unk> I was <unk>
I looked at me -- but I said, <unk>
We did all the way to the border of <unk>
But I had to spend almost all my money to inspire the guards <unk> in <unk>
But even after the presence of the border, my family was <unk> and incarcerated to cross the <unk>
After paying <unk> and <unk> my family was <unk> in a month was <unk>
But at the time, my family was <unk> and incarcerated other time in the capital of <unk>
This was one of the highest dots in my life.
I did all of my family to my family and we were so much, but my family was <unk> in prison to the short distance of the <unk> <unk>
I was going to come up with the office office and the police station, trying to take my family.
But I didn't have enough money to pay more <unk> or <unk>
I lost hope.
In that time, or the voice of a strange man, "What is the problem?
I was so excited that a <unk> will care about.
With my English English and a <unk> I explained the situation, and without <unk> the man was the <unk> <unk> and gave me the rest of the money for my family and for other two <unk> and <unk>
And I took them with all my heart, and I said, "Why do I be <unk>
"I'm not <unk> I said.
I'm helping the village <unk>
I realized that that was a second moment in my life.
<unk> <unk> a new hope for me and for the village <unk> when the <unk>
And I showed me that the kindness of the <unk> and the support of the international community are really the <unk> of hope that the village <unk>
With the time, after our long journey, my family and I grew up in Korea, in North Korea,
But they get their freedom is only half of the battlefield.
Many of them are <unk> of their families and when you get a new country, they start with little or anything.
So we can think of the international community of international community in education, practice of work, and more.
We can also act as a bridge between people within North Korea and the rest of the world.
Because many of us continue in contact with family with family still -- and we send information and money that is helping to change North Korea from inside.
I've been very <unk> I've received a lot of aid and inspiration in my life, so I want to help you give them a <unk> a chance to be able to support the international village.
I'm sure you're going to see more and more <unk> <unk> around the world, including the stage of TED.
Thank you.
I live in <unk>
This is <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
So the one of the city of the city came together, and we said, we're going to change the name of World Center for that <unk> something else, so they changed the Los Angeles as if this <unk> what's actually wrong in the city.
This is Los Angeles   <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
At the kind of <unk> millions of other parents, I live in a heart of food, Los Angeles Center home to the places of food to bring them and eat in the car.
The curious thing is that the places of food to bring them more people than food in the car.
People are dying from infectious diseases in the Los Angeles <unk>
For example, the ice rate in my neighborhood is five times more that, say, <unk> <unk> which is like 15 miles away.
I was <unk> to see that this thing.
And I ask me, how you feel if you didn't have access to food food and if every time you go from home, you see the effects of the <unk> effects, it has in their <unk>
I look at <unk> <unk> and you get them as <unk> cars.
I see <unk> <unk> <unk>
And I think that this must stop.
I think the problem is the solution.
<unk> is the problem and it's the solution.
In addition to me about five minutes of <unk> and go back to buy a apple that doesn't have <unk>
And what did I did was created a <unk> forest in front of my house.
In one of the land we call a <unk>
It's about 45 me from 45 me.
The point is, it gets to the city.
But you have to get it on.
I said, "Well, I can do what I'm going to come on <unk> because it's my responsibility and I have to <unk>
So it was like I decided that I was able to get it.
So my group and I, where my group and I, <unk> <unk> we put us and we start to break our forest of food, trees -- you know, the nine face of the <unk>
What we do that, we are a kind of group of group they were used by <unk> from all the <unk> of all the <unk> of the whole city and completely <unk> and everything we do is free.
And the <unk> was beautiful.
Then somebody <unk>
The city went to me on and <unk> I gave me a <unk> saying that I had to take my <unk> <unk> it made it <unk>
And I said, "You know, I said, "You know, you know it.
One of the <unk> <unk> in a piece of land that no one <unk>   So I was like, "Well, <unk>
Because this time I wasn't going to happen.
<unk> Times had the story written by Steve <unk> and I talked about the <unk> and one of the <unk> members of the <unk> and one of the <unk> members that they put a call in <unk> with 900 <unk>
We had the victory in our hands.
My <unk> even called that <unk> and <unk> what we were doing.
I mean, let's say, let's say, why right?
The city of the United States is the city.
It has <unk> miles <unk>
That's about 20 <unk>
That's a enough for <unk> <unk> millions of <unk>
Why is the hell it doesn't think about this?
<unk> a plant to give about 10 billion plants.
When a dollar of <unk> will give them 75 dollars.
It's my <unk> when I tell people to get your own food.
<unk> your own food is like print your own money.
You see, I have a legacy for <unk>
I grew up there and <unk> my children there.
It was going to be part of this reality <unk> that was <unk> for me for each other, and I'm going to think my own reality.
You see, I am an artist.
<unk> is my <unk> my <unk>
Maybe a <unk> artist <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
I use the face of the land, as a piece of <unk> and the plants, and the plants, are my <unk> of that <unk>
You can see what the land can do.
You just can't imagine the amazing thing that is a <unk> and how it affects people.
What happened?
I am <unk> of how my garden became a way of education, the transformation of my neighborhood.
To change the community, you have to change the landscape of the land.
We are the land.
You get <unk> to see how they affects the kids.
<unk> is the more <unk> act and what you can do, especially in a <unk>
You get <unk>
I remember one occasion, that they came a mother and his daughter, were like the <unk> of the night and they were on the <unk> of the night and they were going to look very <unk>
I feel bad that they were there, and I said, you know, you don't have to do this like this.
This is in the street for a reason.
I felt shame to see people who was so close to me, and this is just doing why I do this, people ask me, <unk> people are going to take your <unk>
I say, "I don't have fear that you go to <unk>
That's the street.
That's what it's about.
I want you to get the <unk> but I want you to be <unk> his <unk>
There was another chance that I put a garden in a <unk> for <unk> in the center of Los Angeles.
They were these guys, that helped me to download the <unk>
It was <unk> my stories about how it was affected and how it used to break with her mom and her grandmother, and it was a lot to see how it was going to look at the time.
So <unk> <unk> has come to plant maybe 20 <unk>
We've got a couple of 50 people who are going to work and <unk> all of the <unk>
If the kids eat <unk> the kids are <unk> <unk>
If you raise <unk> <unk> <unk>  But if nothing of this is you <unk> if you don't ask you how your food affects the mind and the body, they eat the blind what they put in front of you.
I look at young people who want to work, but they have this thing in which they're <unk> I look at the color of color that are in this way to designed for them, which doesn't have to each side.
With <unk> I see a chance where we can train these kids who are <unk> from their communities to have a global life.
And when we do this, who you know?
Maybe you use the next George Washington, <unk>
But if we don't change the landscape of the land, we never do it.
Now this is one of my <unk> this is something that I want to do.
I want to break all of a <unk> <unk> where people can share food in the same term.
I want to take it <unk> and turn them into <unk>
I don't get to me.
I'm not talking about bad things, because it is not a global thing.
The curious thing that you have to <unk>
So what I'm talking about is to put people to work to people from the street, that you know the <unk> the pride and the honor of growing their own food, to wind markets from farmers.
What I want to do here, we have to make it <unk>
I want you all in <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
We have to change the question of what's a <unk>
If you're not a <unk> you're not a <unk>
What the <unk> take your <unk>
What that is your choice.
In <unk> if you want to meet me, well, if you want to look at you -- I don't call me if you want to sit on a little bit of <unk> and having meetings to talk about making some <unk> to talk about making some <unk>
If you want to look at the front of the front of the <unk> so we could play something.
IM: Thank you.
Thank you.
<unk>   <unk> of the <unk>  You probably all be able to take me that this is a very <unk>
It's made of <unk> and <unk> is a good material to <unk> but it doesn't know it not in days like today, where it was a lot.
You can have a huge amount of water in the <unk> that <unk>
And especially if you go out in your bicycle and these cars are not very nice.
In addition, you can make a lot of noise.
It's a <unk> material and if we build <unk> like in the Netherlands, very close to the cities, we want a <unk>
The solution for that is making <unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk> a material that we use now now in most of the roads of the parts of the parts has <unk> and water can happen through it, why all the water water goes down to the sides and they will have a road why it's easy to <unk> and not <unk> water.
The noise also sold in these <unk>
Because it's very <unk> all the noise <unk> so it's a very <unk>
It also has <unk> of course, and the <unk> of this road is that you can <unk>
What is <unk> you see, you see that in this road the rocks of the surface of the surface.
First of the <unk> then we put several more and more and more and more and more, and <unk> well, I'm not going to do that.  But they can be able to be happy with it.
And finally, this can also take more and more harm.
Sometimes you can create <unk> with it.
<unk> <unk>
<unk> of course, you can turn in a problem, but we have a solution.
Here you can see how the damage is in this material.
It's a <unk> <unk> as I said, so it only has a small amount of <unk> between the <unk>
Because the <unk> to the light <unk> this <unk> this <unk> the gun between the <unk> <unk> and if you get <unk> they will be going to be <unk> and they were going to get from the <unk>
So, if you go on the road, <unk> <unk> as we saw here.
To solve this problem, we think of <unk> <unk>
If we can make this material <unk> then you probably have a solution.
So what we can do is to use <unk> <unk> of that to clean <unk> and we can cut the <unk> of steel in a very small pieces and we can make those small pieces with the <unk>
So we have <unk> with small pieces of <unk> in it.
And then you need a machine like that you see here, that you can use a <unk> <unk>
<unk> can <unk> especially the steel is very good in it.
And so what you have to do is <unk> the <unk> <unk> the <unk> the <unk> <unk> by these <unk> and the rocks are going on back to the surface.
I used a <unk> <unk> because I can't bring the great machine <unk> here to the stage.
<unk> is a similar system.
I put the show that I'm going to take to see what happened.
This is the shows that it comes now.
I said that we have this kind of industrial machine in the lab for the <unk>
We have a lot of samples there and then the government, actually saw our results, and they thought, "Well, that's so interesting. We have to be <unk>
So we took us a piece of <unk> 400 meters of the <unk> <unk> where we had to make a test of trial to test this material.
So that was what we did there, you see where we were doing the test on the road, and then, of course, this road last last year for a number of years without any harm.
We take a lot of samples of this road and we test them in the lab.
We did the <unk> the days we put a lot of burden in them, the <unk> then with our <unk> machine and the <unk> and we went back to it.
We can learn this a lot of times.
Well, to conclude, I can say that we have done a material using <unk> fibers using the power of <unk> using the energy of <unk> using the energy of the road, they can even increase the life of the surface of the road, even they can actually save a lot of money with design.
And now of course, they have curious if it also worked.
We still have the sample here. It's pretty hot.
And actually, it has to cool first before you can show you how the <unk>
But I'm going to do a <unk>
So we saw Yeah, it worked.
Thank you.
When I was 11 years old, I remember a morning with the sound of the <unk> in my house.
My father was listening to it turned out in his small <unk>
I had a great smile in your face that was unusual in those time, because the news is not <unk>
The Taliban was <unk> my father.
I didn't know what <unk> but I could see that my father was very, very happy.
"Now you can go to a <unk> school, he said.
One morning I never could.
A school.
You see, I had six years when the Taliban were <unk> of Afghanistan and they did illegal who girls were going to school.
For the next five years ago, I <unk> it as a boy to <unk> my favorite sister that I couldn't be used to be used to go to a giant school.
It was the only way that the two could <unk>
Every day, we took a different way for no one of no one could be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to <unk>
We had to hide the books in the market of the market that it seems to be <unk>
The school was in a home, more than 100 percent of the <unk> in a small room.
It was nice in the winter, but extremely <unk> in the summer.
We all knew that we <unk> our life, the family and our parents.
And instead of the time the school was given up by a week because the Taliban <unk>
We always found what they knew what they were doing.
They were <unk>
Did you know where <unk>
We were <unk> but yet the school was where we wanted to be.
I was very lucky to grow in a family where education was <unk> and the daughters <unk>
My grandfather was a extraordinary man for her time.
A total number of a total <unk> <unk> of Afghanistan.
But my mother turned up to me.
This is it.
He took two years ago, just to turn our house in school for girls and women from our neighborhood.
And my father, this is the first of the whole family in getting education.
There was no doubt that their children had to get education, even their God, even the <unk> despite the <unk> despite the <unk>
For it, there was a greater risk in not to educate their children.
For the years of the <unk> I remember that there was a few times in which I was very excited about our life, and I was always afraid and I didn't see a future.
I wanted to ask them, but my father said, "You can lose everything that you have in life.
You can tell you your money. You can <unk> your house for a war.
But there is one thing that is always going to be shown what is here and if we have to sell our blood to pay your education, what we do it.
So you don't want to do not <unk>
I have 22 years.
I grew up in a country that has been destroyed for decades of war.
Less than six percent of the women of my age have more than the <unk> and if my family didn't have been so excited about my education, I would be one of them.
In change, I find me a proud of <unk> in <unk>
When I went back to Afghanistan, my grandfather, which was <unk> from his home for the <unk> of the <unk> to the <unk> of the <unk> was one of the first in <unk>
He didn't just get my title of my title <unk> but also that I was the first woman, and I am the first woman, that I have moved on the streets of <unk>
My family believe in me.
I dream in big, but my family has even more great dreams to <unk>
It's why I'm the global <unk> of <unk> a global campaign to educate women.
It's why <unk> <unk> the first and perhaps the only school school for girls in Afghanistan, a country in which is still expensive, for girls to go to school.
The exciting thing is, I see the students in my school with the strong desire to take the opportunity.
And I look at their parents and their families that as the <unk> <unk> for them, despite still the <unk> and even in front of a <unk>
As a <unk> is not his real name, and I can't show you your face, but <unk> is the father of one of my students.
At least a month, he was going to get out of the way from <unk> to his village, and literally, <unk> to be killed by a bomb in the way, for minutes.
When you get to your house, they are the phone, a voice that if I had been sending your daughter to school, they were going to be able to stop it.
<unk> you know, if you <unk> he said, "You don't need the future of my daughter for their old and <unk> <unk>
What I've given me to Afghanistan, and it's something that is often often known in the West, is that behind the most of those who <unk> there are a father who recognized the value of their daughter and you see that the success of her own success.
They don't want to say that our mothers have no key in our success.
In fact, often are the first <unk> of the brilliant future of their streets, but in the context of a society as a society, we need the support of men.
<unk> the girls who were the girls who were going to know in <unk> remember, was <unk>
But today, about three million girls are going to school in Afghanistan.
Afghanistan, you see so different from here in America.
I found the Americans see the <unk> of the changes.
<unk> that these changes didn't make a lot, after the <unk> of the U.S.
But when I go back to Afghanistan, when I look at the students in my school and their parents who <unk> for them, that <unk> I see a <unk> future.
For me, Afghanistan is a country of hope and the chances of <unk> and every day the girls were <unk>
As I was born in big.
Thank you.
You have never forgotten the words of my grandmother who died in the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
But you never get a <unk> <unk>
They've been about two years since that the revolution was <unk> by the <unk> of <unk> <unk> so much of the <unk> revolution like <unk>
A forces with many other citizens -- within the country to call a day of <unk> and start a revolution against the <unk> <unk> <unk>
And the <unk> was a big revolution.
Women and men were <unk> they were in the <unk> <unk> the each of the <unk> <unk> and social freedom, dignity and social justice and social justice.
They've shown a <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
They've shown a great sense of <unk> from the <unk> and until the <unk> to the <unk>
And then then after a period of six months of the <unk> and a bunch of about about 50 thousand <unk> we have to take our country and <unk> the <unk>
However, I took a <unk> <unk> a legacy of <unk> corruption and seeds of <unk>
For four decades, by four decades, the <unk> <unk> <unk> the infrastructure, the culture and the moral structure of society.
<unk> of the <unk> and the studies, I've been fascinated with a lot of other women, we rebuild a lot of other women, we will rebuild the <unk> society -- <unk> the transition society -- and <unk>
And there are about 200 organizations in <unk> <unk> and immediately after the each of the <unk> or 300 percent of <unk>
After a period of 33 years ago, I went back to Chicago, and with a single time, I started to organize <unk> about the development of <unk> and skills of leadership.
With a incredible group of women we took the <unk> of <unk> <unk> by the <unk> the <unk> of women, and the <unk> of women, and the <unk> of women, and by the <unk> of the <unk> and the right of the <unk> and peace.
I found me with a very hard environment in the period -- a environment that I was getting more <unk> that are <unk> in the political policies and <unk>
With the time, our business was <unk> and power.
Women won a <unk> of the National Congress in the first elections in <unk> years.
However, it was a little bit about a little bit recently, the <unk> of the choices and the revolution as a everything, were <unk> all the days of violence.
A day we gave us with the news of the <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk>
Another day <unk> with the news of the murder of the American and the heart of the <unk>
Another day we gave us with the news of the murder of the <unk>
And every day, every day, every day with the government of the <unk> and their <unk> <unk> of human rights and the lack of the human rights and their lack of the law.
Our society, they put by a <unk> <unk> and it has come out of the ideals and the early of freedom, dignity, social justice, social justice than we had at the beginning.
<unk> <unk> and <unk> became the <unk> of the solar consequences.
I'm not here today in all of the <unk> with our success story of <unk> <unk> and the wars.
More good I'm here today to tell us as a nation, we choose wrong, we take the wrong decision.
We don't know okay.
Because the choices didn't make the peace, we didn't use the peace, and the security of it.
The list of the list of <unk> and the <unk> between <unk> and <unk> and <unk> <unk>
No, they didn't do it.
What happened about that?
Why do our society is still <unk> and it comes up with political policies and <unk> in the men as <unk>
Maybe it was not just the women, but the <unk> values of compassion, and <unk> and <unk>
Our society needs the national paper, and the creation of consensus that I needed the <unk> that we just need to be <unk> and <unk>
Our nation needs the <unk> <unk> of the more that we need the numbers <unk> and <unk> of it.
We need to try to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to go out of anger.
We need to start to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to start to be able to be able to be able to
We have to develop a <unk> speech that not only <unk> but also it also put it in practice in a place in the <unk> collaboration instead of <unk> the <unk> instead of <unk>
These are the ideals that a <unk> <unk> for war, we need to be able to get the end of peace.
Because peace has a <unk> which is the <unk> and the <unk> between the <unk> and <unk>
That's the true <unk>
We need to build that of a existential way before we do it <unk>
According to a <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> the word of the God <unk> <unk> <unk>
At the time, the word <unk> which is known in all of the <unk> <unk> it has the same root in the <unk> that the word <unk> <unk> the <unk> and <unk> that it affects all of the humanity of men and women, where all of the tribes and all of the tribes that all the tribes and all of the tribes that all the tribes and all of the
And so as the <unk> is completely <unk> the <unk> of compassion that grows into the <unk> <unk>
And so it says, "No, it turns up all the <unk>
And so it says, "No, <unk> <unk> about my <unk>
What they all are going to make them the <unk> of the <unk>
Thank you.
I'm here today to tell you about a <unk> question that has a <unk> response that has a bad answer.
It's about the secrets of violence because of the question that I'm going to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to get a lot of what they all make a lot of <unk>
Why was somebody going to stay with a man that <unk>
I'm not <unk> or no social people, no expert in violence.
I'm just a woman with a story that you go.
I was 22 years old, I had a <unk> in the University of Harvard.
I had moved to New York for my first job as a writer and editor in <unk>
I had my first <unk> my first <unk> <unk> <unk> and I had a very big secret.
My secret was that many, many times, the man, that I believed my soul was <unk> to the head with a <unk> <unk> with <unk> <unk>
The man, that I loved more than no one in this world, put a gun in my head and <unk> with <unk> more times than I can remember it.
I'm here to tell you the story of <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> where they get every year millions of women, and even some men.
It could be the story.
I don't have a typical list of violence violence.
I am <unk> in front of the University of Harvard and I have a <unk> in <unk> <unk> <unk>
I've spent the highest part of my career working in the list of the list of the list of the list of the list of the list of <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and the Washington, <unk>
I've been about 20 years ago with my second husband and we have three children.
My dog is a black <unk> and <unk> a <unk> <unk>
So my first message for you is that violence violence can happen to each other, all the <unk> all of the <unk> and education.
It's all there.
And my second message is that you all think that the violence is going on the women, which is a problem of women.
Not exactly.
More than 70 percent of the <unk> are men, and the <unk> <unk> only happens in relationships -- <unk> <unk> and <unk> or a long time in the families, the last place where we would want or we would expect to find <unk> because of the <unk> the last place where we would want or we would expect to be able to find <unk> because of the <unk> <unk>
I would have told you that it would be the last person in the world that it would be a man who was going to do, and I was a very typical victim because of my age.
I was 22 years old, and in the United States, the women from between 16 and 24 years of the age have three times more likely to be victims of the victims of the victims of the victims of <unk> violence than the other of the other women, and girls are killed in the U.S.
I was also a typical victim because I didn't know anything about violence because their signals of <unk> or their patterns.
I met <unk> in a cold, and <unk> <unk>
I was sitting on my side in the London of New York and started <unk> with me.
He said two things.
The first was that he also had a <unk> of a college college <unk> and I worked in a very important bank of Wall Street and I worked in a very important bank of Wall
But what I was struck me in that first encounter was that it was ready and fun, and it seemed like a boy of the field.
I had a lot of <unk> <unk> as a <unk> and it seemed so much, and it seemed so much.
One of the most intelligent things that did <unk> from the beginning, was to create the illusion that I was the dominant component of a mate.
It made it about all the beginning of <unk> in a <unk>
We started to go back and loved all of me that was list that I had been going to Harvard that I took to help girls and my work.
I wanted to know everything about my family my childhood, my dreams and <unk>
<unk> I believed in me, as a writer and as a woman, as nobody had ever done it.
And it was why I wrote in that <unk> school and work in Wall Street and its brilliant future had so much importance to him.
I didn't know that the first phase in any relationship in any relationship of violence is <unk> and <unk>
And I didn't know that the second step is <unk>
Now the last thing that I wanted to do was I went from New York and I leave the work of my dreams, but I thought I had to do it for your work, so I left my job and <unk> and I went together together with 200 years.
I had no idea that I was <unk> in a <unk> <unk> that I was in the head of the head in a <unk> physical <unk> and <unk>
The next step in the pattern of violence is to find the threat of violence to see how it does.
And here's where you go on the scene those <unk>
In the way we moved to the New Yorker -- you know, that place where you know that <unk> I had to feel so sure I had to feel so sure I had a <unk> three <unk>
One was in the <unk> of the car.
Another <unk> underneath the door in our bed and the third always in his pocket.
And he was saying that they needed those <unk> to cause it a small bit.
I needed to feel safe.
But those of course, they actually were a message for me and even though I had been <unk> my hand, my life was already in serious <unk> every minute of every day.
The first heart attack of <unk> happened five days before our <unk>
It was seven of the morning and I still had a <unk>
Five days later, when the 10 <unk> of my neck had <unk> I put me on the <unk> of my mother and I married with him.
Despite what I was found was sure that we live happy to me, because I loved it, and he also wanted a lot of it.
And I was very, very <unk>
It just had sense very <unk> by the <unk> and the fact that I form a family with me.
I had been a <unk> accident and I would never ask me harm.
I spent two times more in our moon of <unk>
The first time I was going to drive up to a TED beach and <unk> and he gave me so strong in the head that we <unk> several times against the <unk>
And then, a couple of days later, I moved back from our moon of <unk> <unk> by the traffic and he took me a Big <unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk> <unk> one or two times for the next year for the next two years and a half years of our desk.
I <unk> when I thought it was the only in this situation.
One of the three American women is the ice of violence in violence or <unk> in some time of your life, and the <unk> Center that every year 15 million children are <unk> 15 million.
So actually, I had very good company.
I'll go back to my question: Why do I be <unk>
The answer is simple.
I didn't know that he was <unk>
The contrary, I was a very strong woman -- and it was the only person in the world that I could help to help <unk> to help their <unk>
The other question that all the world does is, why just not not be <unk>
Why do you not <unk> I could have been in any time.
For me this is the most sad question and why do people do people, because we do the vulnerable we know something that you usually usually <unk> is incredibly dangerous to get a <unk>
Because the last phase in the pattern of violence is <unk>
More than 70 percent of the <unk> in cases of violence in the cases of domestic violence now after the victim has gotten to the relationship, after <unk> because then the <unk> has no idea that I want.
Other of the <unk> they include <unk> <unk> even after the <unk> has come back to the <unk> <unk> of resources and produce the <unk> system of family to <unk> to the victim and their kids, who usually are forced by the judges to spend time <unk>
And we're still going to ask me why just it is just <unk>
I was able to tell you the causes of a last <unk> I took them to get up to the <unk>
I realized that the man who loved me, I would have been <unk>
So I took the silence.
I told all the whole world to the <unk> to my friends and friends and <unk> <unk> and I'm here today because all of you.
We have the tendency to <unk> the victims like headlines <unk> women <unk>
The question, "Why do you be <unk>
So for some people is a way to say, "The <unk> is <unk> by <unk> as if the victims of <unk> <unk> <unk> men who want to <unk>
But since I published <unk> <unk> I've heard about the stories of men and women that they also learned that they learned and they learned their lives life lives and happy lives in their lives and happy lives completely free lives like mine.
Because it turns out that I really am a victim and a little bit of a very big violence.
I went back to a <unk> man, and you have those three children.
I have that <unk> black <unk>
What will not be going to have to have to have no other people -- you know, it is a <unk> <unk> my head on the hands of somebody who says to me.
In this moment, as they're thinking, <unk> that is <unk> or <unk> which would be <unk> but all this time I actually have been talking about you.
I promise you that there are a few people, which is a few people who are hearing now now that they're being <unk> or that they were a little bit of them and they're <unk> themselves.
The <unk> could be able to be able to get their daughter, to his best friend right now.
I was able to put the end of my favorite love to make the silence.
And I'm going to be doing today.
It's my way to help other vulnerable and it's my end of you.
Talk about what you've heard here.
<unk> only in the silence.
They have the power of the end of the <unk> violence -- just take light on it.
<unk> we need around the world.
We need that every one of you understand the secrets of violence violence.
<unk> the <unk> to the light talking about that with their kids, their hands of work, their friends and family.
<unk> their vision of the reputation as good people and <unk> that have a <unk> future.
<unk> the <unk> signs of violence to be able to try to stop their <unk> and show them to the victims of a healthy <unk>
And so we can turn our <unk> our <unk> and our family and our families in the <unk> and <unk> that they should be.
Thank you.
Hi. I call it <unk> <unk> and since a time, I am model.
To be <unk> from 10 years.
And I feel that in this moment there is a bad tension in the room because it shouldn't have been dressed like like that.  luckily, I've asked them her <unk>
This is the first change in a stage of <unk> so you have a lot of <unk> I think.
If some of the women are <unk> when you <unk> you don't have to be <unk> now, but I can find it more late in Twitter.
I also want to point that I have the privilege of being able to change what you think about me in this just 10 seconds.
Not all the world has that opportunity.
These <unk> are very <unk> less bad than I haven't got to learn.
The worst part is going to happen on the head, because it is when you're going to get them to me, so you don't do anything as a <unk>
All right.
Why do I do that?
It's been <unk>
Well, I hope that not as this picture.
<unk> is powerful, but also <unk>
I've changed what they thought about me in six seconds.
And in this picture, I had never had a father in real life.
I was completely uncomfortable and the photographer told me that I was going to get back to the back and <unk> <unk>
So of course, except with surgery or a artificial chip like that I did a two days for the work, there are very little that we can do to make our way to make our way that although <unk> and <unk> has a huge impact in our lives.
So today, for me, being <unk> means to be <unk>
I'm in this stage because I am a model.
Because I'm a beautiful woman and white, and in my solar sector, that is being a <unk>
I'm going to answer the questions that people always do, but <unk>
The first question is, how it comes to be <unk>
And I always say, a <unk> me, but that doesn't mean anything.
The real reason I did a model is because I won the <unk> <unk> and I am the <unk> of a <unk> and maybe they're asking what this is <unk>
Well, in the past centuries we have not only defined the beauty as health health, and <unk> which we are <unk> <unk> to <unk> we have connected to a high and <unk> <unk> and a white violence.
And that's my discovery that I've learned to be able to make money.
And I know that there are people in the audience that now shows <unk> and maybe there are some <unk> of the way that <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
First of all, the <unk> to know so many of models.
But unfortunately, I have to say that in 2007, a <unk> student in the University of New York told all and every one of the models in the <unk> and the <unk> models -- just <unk> is to say, less than four percent, they were not <unk>
The next question that people always do is, you can be a model when it's <unk>
And my first answer is, I don't know, I don't get to it.
But later, what I really would say to each one of these girls is: Why?
You can be released from the United States, or the <unk> of the next Internet, or a <unk> <unk> and <unk> which would be <unk> because it would be <unk>
If after this list list still <unk> No, no, I want to be a model -- then I say, I know my <unk>
Because I'm not aware of all, and you could be the <unk> <unk> of the American magazine or the <unk> <unk> or the next Steven <unk>
Knowing that most of you want to be a model is like saying you want to win the <unk> when you be larger.
It's outside of your control, it's <unk> and it's not a job that you can see.
I'm going to show you all of what I learned about 10 years as a model -- because of the difference of surgery <unk> it can be <unk>
I don't know what happened there.
Unfortunately, one time you can take your studies, and you have a staircase and a few jobs and a few jobs and a few jobs to your own, you don't matter what <unk> is to say, if you know that you want to be <unk> in the United States, but your <unk> <unk> <unk>
The next question that people always do is if all the pictures is <unk>
And yeah, you have a lot of <unk> all the pictures, but that's just a small part of what happens.
This was the first picture that I <unk> and also the first time I used a <unk> and I didn't even have even my time.
I know that we're going into the personal <unk> but it was a girl.
So it went along with my grandmother a few months before.
These two pictures are the same day.
My friend came with me.
Here I'm in a <unk> party before the pictures before the pictures of the pictures of the <unk>
Here I'm with my football team and the <unk>
And this is me in the time.
And I hope that you realize that I'm not me in those photos.
They are <unk> from a group of <unk> <unk> and <unk> and all their <unk> and all their <unk> and people and <unk> and they can create this. That's not me.
Well, the next question that people always do is, <unk> things.
I have too enough to 20 inches and that they never use except the couple earlier, but the <unk> that I get is the ones that I get in real life, and that we don't like to talk about.
I grew up in Cambridge, and once I went to a shop and I forgot to take me money, and I gave me the <unk> free.
When I was a teenager, I was born with my friend who was a <unk> <unk> he turned up a red line and of course, and of course, we <unk> it and <unk> a <unk> it was going to keep <unk>
<unk> of these <unk> for my way, not why I am. And there are people who are paying a price for their aspect of what they are.
I live in New York, and the last year of the <unk> <unk> to the people who were hearing and <unk> <unk> percent were black and <unk> and most of them were young men.
And only there are a lot of <unk> young black and <unk> in New York, so that for them, it's not a question of <unk>
But how many of how many of how many of how many of how I <unk>
When you look at this talk, I learned that the 53 percent of the girls of 13 years in the United States don't like your body, and that is the number of <unk>
So the last question that people do is: How is the life of a <unk>
And I think the answer that you know is, if you're a little bit more nice and you have the most nice hair and you have a very happy hair and <unk>
And behind the software, we give you a answer that maybe you get it.
<unk> it's really wonderful <unk> and also amazing power to work with creative people and <unk>
And everything is the way, but it's just a part of what it happens, because what we never say in front of the cameras, what I never said in front of them.
And I am because I have to worry about my way every day.
And if you think if you think about some more <unk> legs and the more <unk> being more <unk>
They just have to meet with a group of models, because they have the most <unk> legs -- the oldest <unk> and the <unk> and they probably probably be the more <unk> women of the planet.
But about all it was hard to look at a <unk> situation, and <unk> when I am one of the biggest <unk>
If there is something that I know about this talk, I hope that they all feel more comfortable to recognize the power of the image that we have the success and the failure.
Thank you.
The photograph has been my passion since that was the most good enough to take a camera, but today, I want to share with you my 15 pictures of <unk> and I didn't have me who <unk>
There was no <unk> <unk> no chance to take the pictures, not even a matter of the pictures, not even a matter in the <unk>
In fact, most of them took the <unk>
My story begins when I <unk> in the city of New York to give me a <unk> my wife, I took me this picture to me to my daughter in the day of the first time of the first <unk>
And then the fact that we went to New York just a year later, so we decided to take the same picture.
Well, you can imagine what it comes now.
When the third birthday of my daughter, my wife, told me why you don't give you to <unk> to New York in a <unk> journey, and you get <unk>
Here is when we start to ask the <unk> that they were going to take us to the <unk>
It's amazing that the test of giving the camera to a complete <unk> it's so popular.
No one has never been <unk> and luckily, no one has been <unk> with the camera.
So we were not aware of how much the life will change the life.
It became something of the <unk> for us.
This picture is about a few weeks after the <unk> and I had to explain to my daughter that I had happened that day that one day of five years was able to understand.
These pictures are a lot more than a <unk> moment or a <unk>
They are also a way to stop the time in a week of October and we would think about our time and our evolution at the long of the years, and not only a physical level, but in all of the senses.
Because, even though we always have the same picture, our view of the <unk> <unk> and I can see life through their eyes through their eyes and how it interacts with everything.
That time that we spend together is something that we hope with illusion all the year.
Recently, in one of the <unk> we were <unk> when a sudden, he stopped <unk> and sign a red <unk> of the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
And this is what I had sense about five years in the same place.
<unk> that <unk> their heart <unk> with the force to see that place for the first time nine years ago.
And now what you look at in New York who look at in New York who look like to study in New York.
And suddenly I understood that one of the most important things that we create is <unk>
So, I want to share the idea of participate in the creation of <unk>
I don't know you, but over these 15 pictures, I don't get them in a lot of the pictures of them.
I'm always the <unk>
I want to give you all going to give you all of you in the picture, and they didn't get them to somebody and <unk> we give them a <unk>
Thank you.
I'd like to talk about a very special group of animals.
There are 10 species of birds in the world.
<unk> are found in the group of <unk> <unk>
First of all, why they have so bad <unk>
It has been associated with Disney <unk> like characters <unk> <unk>
More recently, if you have been following the press <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> these are the attributes that we use with <unk> <unk> but I don't know it.
I don't know you know about what?
Because the members of the villages don't keep the <unk> the environment.  <unk> don't help prevent prevent the spread of disease.
<unk> are <unk>   They are far from <unk>  And my favorite words, they have better presence.    There are two types of <unk> in this planet.
There's the <unk> of the New York who are found mostly in the <unk> as the <unk> and the <unk> and the <unk> and the <unk> and the <unk> and the <unk> and the <unk> and the <unk> of the <unk>
So why do the <unk> are important in the first place, they provide <unk> <unk>
They are our <unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk> to the bone.
They get to kill all of the objects all of the <unk> <unk> that it will not be for them and make great <unk> and <unk> and diseases in other animals.
They've shown that in the areas where there is no <unk> <unk> you take three to four times more time in <unk> and this has enormous <unk> in the spread of disease.
<unk> also have huge importance of <unk>
They've been associated with the ancient culture.
<unk> was the symbol of the <unk> and the <unk> and along with the <unk> <unk> the unit between the <unk> and <unk> Egypt.
In the <unk> <unk> <unk> was the gay god, and he accepted their life to save the <unk> <unk> of 10 <unk>
In the <unk> culture, they are doing very important about a very important bit of a lot of important <unk> in places like <unk> there are no place for the <unk> or wood for <unk> so that these <unk> provide a system of the natural system.
What is the problem with <unk>
We have eight species of <unk> in Kenya, which six are in the end of the <unk>
The reason is that they're being <unk> and the reason that they're being <unk> is because there are conflicts between humans and the <unk> and <unk> communities are used to use it against the <unk> and as a result, the <unk> are victims of this.
In the south of Asia, in countries like India and Pakistan, four species of <unk> are in the <unk> list of <unk> which means that in less than 10 or 15 years ago -- and the reason is because they grow from the energy consumption like <unk>
This drug has been accepted to use <unk> in India and have taken a <unk>
Because there are no <unk> has been a spread in the number of dogs <unk> in <unk> and when you have dogs <unk> it has a huge bomb of time to <unk> the number of years of the <unk>
Kenya is going to have one of the biggest <unk> <unk> in <unk> <unk> are going to be outside of the lake <unk>
I'm not against energy energy, but we have to work with the governments, because they have to work with the governments, because the wisdom are doing this to the <unk>
They're <unk>
In Africa -- there are a horrible <unk> <unk> <unk> to serve the <unk> and the market.
So what is you doing? Well, we're looking at these birds. We are <unk> <unk>
We are trying to determine their basic <unk> and see where they are.
We can see that they put up for different countries, so we can focus on a whole problem -- it's not going to be <unk>
We have to work with the governments in the <unk>
We're working with local communities.
We are talking about them about <unk> to the <unk> on the need to appreciate these wonderful creatures and the services that they <unk>
How can you be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to write a letter to your government and tell you we have to focus on these very <unk> creatures.
When you go out of this room, and you ask you about the <unk> but talk about their families, with their kids, with their kids with their neighbors on the <unk>
They are very <unk> Charles Darwin said that changed from opinion because the saw it was going to fly without <unk> <unk>
Kenya, this world, being much more poor without these beautiful species.
Thank you very much.
Every thing that I think and all of what I do <unk> my life, has been <unk> by seven years of work for my youth in Africa.
And since <unk> until <unk> <unk> -- but I didn't believe it.  I worked in Cairo, Kenya, from <unk> <unk> and <unk> in the projects of cooperation with African countries.
I worked for a <unk> <unk> and every project we set in Africa <unk>
And I was <unk>
<unk> to the <unk> that we were good people and we were doing a good job in Africa.
And instead of that, all of that, all of the <unk>
Our first project, which inspired my first book, <unk> of the <unk> was a project where a couple of <unk> we decided to teach people of <unk> to grow food.
So we got with <unk> seeds in the south of the <unk> to this absolutely beautiful <unk> and we teach the local <unk> and we teach the local <unk> and <unk> and <unk>
Of course, people were not in all of them in all of them in doing that, so that they were going to get them to come to work, and some times, they didn't get them to work and some times, they didn't get them out of the local <unk>
However, instead of asking you how to ask you how it was possible that we didn't know anything, we just said, "Thank God that we're here --  <unk> to save the people of <unk> <unk>
And of course, everything in Africa are <unk>
We've got these <unk> <unk> in Italy, a <unk> they got to this size.
And we can't believe it, we were saying to the <unk> <unk> what easy is the <unk>
When the guards were <unk> <unk> and <unk> from the night of the morning, about 200 <unk> came from the river and they went on it,  And we said to the <unk> "Oh my God, the <unk>
And the <unk> they said, "Yes, why we don't have agriculture here --  "Why don't you be <unk> they never <unk>
I thought that only of us who would have the <unk> <unk> mistakes in Africa, but then, I saw what they did the Americans, what they did -- and then you can see what they were doing, and then you see what they were doing, I felt pretty proud of our project in <unk>
Because as you can see, at least we can see the <unk>
<unk> look at the <unk>  <unk> see the <unk> that we were going to give them to the <unk> people in Africa.
It wants to read a book, I read <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
The book came on in the <unk>
<unk> countries have been given to the African continent two million dollars in the last 50 years.
I don't tell you about the damage that that money has <unk>
I just read his book.
<unk> from a <unk> woman the damage that we've done.
<unk> are <unk> <unk> <unk> and we try to people just about two times or the <unk> or we are <unk>
The two words comes from the <unk> <unk> which means <unk>
However, the two different things.
<unk> I try any one of a different culture like if you were my kids, "I want a lot.
<unk> I try all of a different culture as if you were my <unk>
So the white fields are called <unk>
That book gave me a <unk> in the face. "I'm <unk> written by <unk> who said about all economic development -- if people don't want to be <unk> <unk>
This is being the first beginning of help.
The first principle of aid is <unk>
This morning, the gentleman who opened up this conference put a fortune on the floor and he said, we can see it, you can see a city that is not <unk>
I decided to the 27 years just to answer the people, and I invented a system called <unk> <unk> where you have never seen anything, you have ever got no one, but it turns out in a <unk> of the local passion who have the dream in a better person.
So, what does you do is <unk>
It would never get a community with a idea, and I feel with the people of the <unk>
We don't work from the <unk>
We grew up in a coffee. We put them in a <unk>
We have zero infrastructure.
And what do we do it in friends, and we found what the person wants to do.
The most important thing is the passion.
You can give you an idea to something.
If that person don't want to do that, what is going to do it.
The passion that she has for their own growth is the most important thing.
The passion that that man has for their own personal growth is the most important thing.
And then, we're helping you to find the knowledge because nobody in the world can be successful alone.
The person with the idea can not have the knowledge, but the knowledge is available.
So I had a few years ago, and I had this idea: Why do we not us, for a place instead of getting a community to tell people what to do, why no, for a time, they <unk>
I'll tell you a secret.
There are a problem with the meetings in the <unk>
The entrepreneurs never <unk> and they would never get them in a public meeting what you want to do with their own money, what a opportunity have been away.
So the family has this <unk>
In the most dangerous people in their community, you don't even know the <unk> because they didn't even know your public jobs.
What do we do we do we do a one of one, and we work face to face, you have to create a social infrastructure, which doesn't exist.
You must create a new <unk>
<unk> is the medical doctor in the company, the medical doctor who was turned out with you in your house, in the table of his kitchen, and they help you find the resources to transform their passion in a way of life.
I started this as a test in <unk> the city of Australia in Australia in Australia in Australia in Australia in Australia in Australia in Australia in Australia in Australia in Australia in Australia in Australia in Australia in Australia in Australia in Australia in Australia in Australia in Australia in Australia in Australia in Australia in Australia in Australia in Australia in Australia in Australia in Australia in Australia
I was doing a Ph.D. at that time, trying to get from this <unk> <unk> where we got to tell you what to do.
In a year, I had 27 projects in <unk> and the government came up to see to ask, "How can you do that?
How can you do this, and I said, "Well, something very, very, very hard.
It was <unk> and <unk>   So the government says, <unk> <unk>  We've done in 300 communities in the world.
We have helped to start 40 business.
There is a new generation of entrepreneurs who are dying in <unk>
Peter <unk> one of the most <unk> <unk> <unk> of the story, I spent a few years ago.
Peter <unk> was a professor of philosophy before the business, and this is what he says, Peter <unk> <unk> is actually <unk> with a society and an economy economy.
<unk> is the kiss of the death of the death of the U.S.
So now you know, <unk> <unk> <unk> without knowing what the most <unk> people in <unk> want to do with their own money and their own energy.
You have to learn to make these people to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be
You have to give you a <unk> <unk> you have to be fantastic to the <unk> and then <unk> come up in mass.
In a community of 10 people, we have 200 <unk>
You can imagine a community of 400 people and the intelligence and <unk>
What is you going to make you more <unk>
People <unk> That's what you have <unk>
So, what I say is that the spirit spirit is where it is.
We are at the end of the first industrial revolution -- <unk> <unk> we don't have <unk> and from a moment to another, we have systems that aren't <unk>
The <unk> engine is not sustainable.
The <unk> as a way to support <unk> is not sustainable.
What we have to discuss is how to <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> to seven billion people, in a global way.
There are no technologies to do it.
Who is going to invent the technology for the <unk> revolution.
<unk> <unk>
They're going to be doing the entrepreneurs and they're doing right now.
There is a <unk> story that was in a magazine -- so many years ago.
There was a group of experts who were forced to debate the future of the New York City in the year of <unk>
And in the year of <unk> it came up with this group of people -- and <unk> what was going to happen to the city of New York in 100 years old, and the conclusion was <unk> the city of New York -- not <unk> within 100 years.
Why? Because they run the curve and <unk> if the population is connected to this <unk> to move up to the population of New York to <unk> <unk> six million <unk> and we took it up for six million women, it would be impossible to <unk>
They were already <unk> in <unk>   So, in <unk> they were <unk> this <unk> technology that <unk> the life of New York.
So what is going on in the next 40 years ago in 1900, in the United States in the United States in the United States came up <unk> companies -- <unk> companies <unk>
The idea of finding a different technology was absolutely <unk> and there were very excited -- <unk> factories in places.
<unk> <unk> <unk>
However, there's a secret to work with the entrepreneurs.
First of all, you have to write <unk>
All other way, they won't go to you with you.
Then you have to give you a <unk> <unk> <unk>
And then you have to tell you the truth with <unk>
The more small company the greatest company has to be able to make three things -- the product that you want to sell it has to be <unk> you have to be extremely <unk> you have to tell them with a fantastic <unk>
Do you know what?
We have been known to a single human being in the world that can be able to sell and looking for the money itself.
It doesn't exist.
This is still not me.
We've looked at the <unk> and looked at the 100 companies in the world -- <unk> <unk> Ford all the new companies -- Google, <unk>
There is just one thing that all of the basic companies in the world have in the world have in common.
It would not have the word -- but the word <unk> 32 times.
He was not just when I was doing it.
No one starts a company a company itself.
So we can create the community where we have <unk> who have <unk> who come from a small business environment in <unk> along along with their <unk> <unk> who will be going to be <unk> what somebody did come on this gentleman who are talking about this <unk>
What can you do <unk> you can do this.
Well, you can <unk> it can look for the <unk>
"Oh, no, I can't do that." <unk> that I was going to be <unk>
We use communities.
Thank you.
Those of us, you can help us help us help us make many ways to improve our lives.
We don't know all the <unk> so that we don't want to make a lot of knowledge despite sharing the public spaces.
In the past years I've been trying to share more with my neighbors in the public space with simple tools like <unk> and <unk>
These projects came from questions like, how much they pay my neighbors for their <unk>
How can we ask them and ask more things without call the door in a bad time.
How do you share more memories of our buildings and understanding better our <unk>
How do you share more our hopes in the <unk> cows for our communities that our communities can reflect today our needs and <unk>
I live in New <unk> and I'm sitting from New <unk>
My soul is always fighting with the <unk> <unk> that you have <unk> <unk> and <unk> from centuries -- and I think about about centuries and believe in a city.
It always gives it to the music.  There is a <unk> in New <unk>   The city has one of the most beautiful <unk> in the world, but also one of the most beautiful amount of U.S.
I live close to this house and thought how it could make it in a more nice space for the neighborhood and also in something that changed my life forever.
In 2009, I lost somebody who loved a lot.
It was <unk> as a mother for <unk>
And his death was <unk>
I thought a lot of death and death and I thought a lot of death and I thought a lot of death and I thought about the death and I thought a lot about the death and I thought a lot about the death and I thought about the death and I thought a lot about the death and I thought a lot about the death and I thought about
And this led to me a profound job for the time.
I realized the important things of my life.
But <unk> for keep this look at my life.
It seems to be easy to be able to be able to be able to be able to get the day and forget what's really important for one.
So with the help of old and new friends became the wall of this <unk> <unk> in a giant <unk> and I call it on it to <unk> <unk>
So the <unk> they could take a <unk> we think about their lives and share and share more personal topics in space space.
I didn't know what to wait for this experiment but the day the wall was sitting and still <unk>
And I'd like to share some things that people wrote on the wall.
He came to die like to be <unk>   <unk> <unk> I want to sit on the <unk> of <unk>
He came to die about millions of <unk>
I was trying to die a <unk> <unk>
I was trying to live outside of the <unk>
I was trying to die -- I want to get <unk> a time.
He came to die I want to go to the <unk>
I came to die to be completely <unk>
This space is <unk> <unk> and dreams and hopes of people asked me to <unk> me, and I gave me a lot of good times to me.
It's about to know that you're not alone. It's about to understand our <unk> of ways and <unk> it's about giving them to the <unk> and the <unk> and I remember what is the most important thing for us as we grow and <unk>
This last year and I started to get hundreds of messages of people that they wanted to do a wall in their community.
So that with my colleagues in the center of the <unk> we did a <unk> and now they have been done in countries around the world around the world, like <unk> South Africa and <unk>
And so we took the power of our public spaces, if you give us the opportunity to try and share each other.
Two of the most effective things that we have the time and our relationships with other people.
In our age of <unk> which is more important than I had to be able to find the ways of <unk> the perspective and remember that life is happy.
The death is something that we often have to talk about, or even thinking, but I understood that to be to death is one of those things that we can make more power.
I think about death <unk> our life.
Our buildings can make better things that matters as individuals and as a community and more means to share them, and stories, people who are, can't only help improve places can help improve our lives.
Thank you.
Thank you.
I have a only <unk>
Please tell you that I am normal I am <unk>
Now I'd like to introduce you to my <unk>
<unk> has 22 years old, it's high and very <unk>
I don't know it, but they put some better than some of the best men.
<unk> knows what the love.
You have <unk> it was going to do what it is.
It's not <unk> no color of the skin.
They don't care about the white differences and notice in this: never <unk>
When we choose the songs of our childhood, trying to ask words of the words that I didn't even be able to get me one thing: I remember what we know about the mind and the wonderful thing that it must be <unk>
Samuel <unk> has 16 years old, it's very <unk>
<unk> the more <unk>
However, it's a <unk>
I don't remember if I was my <unk> but I remember the year that I went up every single one of the National songs that we had -- when I had four years ago to get on my arm on my arm during the first of the <unk> and <unk> <unk>
It doesn't seem to me.
But most people are not about it.
And in fact, because their minds is not going to be <unk> the concept of <unk> often are often <unk> and <unk>
But what it turned to my heart and <unk> my soul was that even if that was the case, though I was the case, although I was not the <unk> within the <unk> that would only mean a thing: which was <unk> and <unk>
Now, for those people familiar with the term <unk> it is a brain disorder which affects social communication, in learning social communication, and sometimes as well.
In every individual of the individual <unk> in the way that <unk> it's so different to you.
And in all the world, every 20 minutes, they are going to take a new case of autism, and although it's one of the development disorders that more fast increases in the world, there is no cause no cause or <unk>
I don't remember my first encounter with autism but I don't remember one day without it.
I had only three years when my brother came to the world, and I was very excited about having a new being in my life.
When I spent a few months, I realized that he was different.
<unk> a lot.
I didn't want to play as the other babies and in fact, it wasn't very interested in me at all.
<unk> lived and <unk> in their own world, with their own rules, and they were pleasure on the smaller things like to put their cars around the room around the room, you look at the machine and eat any thing that would have got to each other.
As I grew up on the more different, and the differences are made more <unk>
But beyond the <unk> the frustration and <unk> <unk> there was something really <unk> a bad nature -- and a kid that I saw the world without them, a human being never <unk>

I can't think that there have been some very hard times in my family, moments in which I would have thought they were just like me.
But I look back to the things that have taught me about the <unk> the communication and love, and I realize that they're things that they would not want to change the normal.
<unk> is about the beauty that we give us the differences and the fact of being a different thing is not wrong.
It just means that there's a different vision of what's right.
If I could <unk> a single thing to <unk> and <unk> and you would be that they don't have to be normal to be normal to be normal.
You can be <unk>
Because the <unk> or not, the differences that <unk> are a <unk> every one of us has a gift in its inside and <unk> the search of <unk> is the last <unk>
The opportunity for the <unk> the progress and the change in the time we try to be as the others.
<unk> I don't tell you that I'm normal I am <unk>
Thank you.
Five years ago, I spent a little bit of what it must be <unk> in the end of the <unk>
Mr. State asked me to me, a professor of communications, that I took a kind of communication of communication in engineering.
I was scared.  <unk> <unk> <unk> of these students with their big books, their big books and the big books and <unk> words.
But at the <unk> those <unk> I felt what <unk> should be a sense when he fell on the hole of the <unk> and saw the door of a new world.
I felt when I had those conversations with the students with the students to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to make other people -- and I wanted other people to be also this wonderful.
And I think the key to open that door is a big communication.
We need a big communication of our scientists and engineers with the end of changing the world.
Our scientists and engineers are the ones that are making our greatest challenges from energy and health care of health, and health care of health, and if we don't know that we don't understand this, the work is not done, and I think it's our responsibility as we haven't done, and I think it's our responsibility as we haven't done, and I think it's our responsibility as we haven't done,
But these great conversations can't happen to happen if our scientists and engineers will not get them to see their wonderful world.
So scientists and engineers, please <unk> with <unk>
I want to share some suggestions about how you can do it to make sure that we can see it to make sure that the science is <unk> and that the engineering is <unk>
First question for <unk> and then what?
<unk> why science is relevant to us.
We don't tell you just that we study the <unk> but that we study the <unk> that are the <unk> structure of our bones because it's important to understand and try to try the <unk>
And when they're going to put your science, care of the <unk>
<unk> is a <unk> for our understanding of their ideas.
All of you can say, <unk> and <unk> but why don't not say <unk> and <unk> which is much more likely to us?
<unk> <unk> is not the same thing to make it <unk>
The contrary, as he said, Einstein, that everything is so easy as possible, but not simple.
You can communicate it clearly its science without <unk> ideas.
Something to consider is to be able to use these stories and <unk> are ways and <unk> with the content.
And to present their work, forget about the signs of <unk>
They have asked why they call <unk>  What do you make the <unk> the <unk> and <unk> and <unk> his presentation.
A <unk> like this is not just a surprise but it is going too much in the area of the language of our brain and <unk>
Instead, this <unk> <unk> <unk> is a lot more efficient it shows that the special structure of the <unk> is so strong that I really inspired the only one of the only <unk>
The trick here is to use a simple phrase <unk> that the audience can understand if you lost a little bit, and then to provide <unk> to our other senses, and they think a more profound sense of understanding what they <unk>
I think these are just some key that you can help the other <unk> the door and see the country of the reasons that is science and engineering.
And so scientists and engineers, when you have been <unk> this is not all the <unk> <unk>   Thank you.
One of my favorite words of all the <unk> of New York <unk>
It just sounds very well.
And <unk> means <unk> <unk>
Although there was a <unk> <unk> of the 19th century, which is a lot of better when he said, "A <unk> is that you can look for a public in the audience without matter or first, and that, when I put it on it through the <unk> use <unk>
I have no idea that it means <unk>
Something to see with the words, I guess.
It's very important that the words will be the basis in politics, and all politicians know that they have to try to make the language.
It was not <unk> for example, <unk> that <unk> <unk> allowed to the <unk> words that they said in the camera <unk>
And all of this was because of a kind of kind of kind of kind of guy with the <unk> <unk> who I found the <unk>
They put them on the <unk> of London and <unk> but it had enough to face them, and at the end it had such a popular support in London that <unk>
And only about a few years later, we had the first use of the phrase <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> like <unk>
Most of you think it's <unk>
It's not a <unk> <unk>
But to show you really how the words and political policy, I want to go back to the United States, just after <unk>
So, they had to take the question of how to call George Washington, his leader.
I don't know.
How do you take the leader of a country <unk>
This is <unk> in Congress for a long time.
They were all kinds of suggestions that might be <unk>
Some of them wanted to call it <unk> <unk> and the other <unk> George <unk> and other <unk> of the <unk> <unk>
Not very <unk>
Some of you just wanted to call it <unk>
It was that it was a <unk>
And not even with it was <unk> they had the idea that you could be chosen for a <unk>
And it might be <unk>
All the world is <unk> <unk> because this debate is <unk> for three weeks ago.
And the day of a poor <unk> and always <unk> with this <unk>
What led the <unk> and the <unk> was that the <unk> <unk> was in <unk>
The <unk> <unk> I didn't want to Washington, <unk> <unk>
They didn't want to call it King for if it was not going to get him or your ideas.
So I wanted to give you the more <unk> and more <unk> that I came on.
And that title was <unk>
"Now I didn't invented the <unk> there was before, but it just meant <unk> that <unk> a <unk>
It was like the president of a <unk>
And I didn't have a lot more <unk> than the term <unk> or <unk>
There was <unk> <unk> of small <unk> <unk> and <unk> of government, but it was really an actor.
And that's why the <unk> <unk>
They said, "We can't call it <unk>
"This guy has to give them and to meet with <unk> <unk>
"And who do you take a serious title with a title of <unk> and <unk> as President of <unk>
And then finally, after three weeks of <unk> the <unk> don't <unk>
We can learn three things about all this.
First of all, and this is my favorite way where I've been able to figure out the <unk> never <unk>
The President Barack Barack has been lucky to keep there, waiting to the car between the <unk>
The second thing that we can learn is that when a government says that a kind of government is <unk>   <unk> that we will go to <unk>
But the third thing that we can learn, and this is the most important, and this is the most importantly, and this is that the title of President of the U.S. doesn't sound in all of the <unk> today.
So all if you have more about 5,000 solar arms -- the biggest economy of the world and a <unk> <unk> <unk> and so on.
The reality of the story have been hearing the title of <unk>
So the end won the <unk>
They got his title of <unk>
And also the other concern of the <unk> the <unk> <unk>
But you know how many nations have now <unk>
And all because they want to sound like the guy that has the 5,000 heads and and so on.
So at the end of the end of the <unk> I won the <unk> <unk> because no one one is going to feel some of all, when you tell you that now they're the President of <unk>
And I think that's the great lesson that we can learn, and that I'd like to <unk>
The politicians try to choose and use the words to be able to control and control the reality, but actually the reality is a lot more the words that these might change the reality.
Thank you very much.
I'm 45 feet under the land in a illegal college <unk>
The air is <unk> and dust and it's hard to breathe.
I feel the face of bodies in the darkness, but I can't see a lot more.
I hear voices that talk about, but about all, that <unk> of <unk> <unk> and rocks <unk> with <unk>
As the others else, I have a little bit of the <unk> of light <unk> <unk> to the head with this <unk> <unk> and I can barely distinguish the <unk> <unk> that they choose the walls of that hole in a meter where it comes up hundreds of meters on the land.
It was <unk> my hand and suddenly I remember a <unk> I met a few days before, who lost the control of the <unk>
As I talk about you today, these men are in the deep of that hole on the <unk> <unk> <unk> and often, dying.
I went back from that hole and I went home but they may never get it, because they're <unk>
In the past 28 years ago, I was made by <unk> cultures in over 70 countries, and in 2009, I had the great honor of being the only <unk> in the <unk> of <unk>
Between all the amazing people that I met there, I met a <unk> of <unk> the <unk> a <unk> which is going to eradicate the modern medicine.
We started talking about slavery and really, I started to learn about slavery because I knew that there was in the world but not as far.
When we end out of talking that I felt very <unk> I was <unk> to ignore this <unk> of our days and I thought, if I don't know, how many people don't know.
I made me a deal with the iPhone, and weeks later, I flew to Los Angeles to meet the director of <unk> the <unk> and I think my help.
So I started my journey to the modern possibility.
So I had been in many of these places.
Sometimes I had even even the age my second home.
But this time, <unk> <unk>
A <unk> <unk> says that now there are more than 27 million people in the world.
It's the <unk> of the number of African Africans for all the <unk> <unk>
150 years ago, the cost of a company was about about three times the <unk> <unk> of a U.S.
The equivalent of about the equivalent of <unk> today.
However, today, you can make families around the generations of <unk> <unk> <unk>
You know, the birds generates the most of about 13 billion the year around the world.
A lot of people have been <unk> with a lot of good education and better work to then discover that they are forced to work without <unk> under violence under violence and they can't understand.
Today, the <unk> <unk> in the <unk> the goods produced by <unk> but those who are produce <unk>
<unk> exists in almost all the world, and yet it's illegal around the world.
In India and <unk> I met the <unk>
This is strange and <unk> was like to get the ancient Egypt or <unk> <unk>
<unk> in an temperature temperature of <unk> men, men, women, women, in fact, in fact, in fact, in fact, in fact, in fact, in fact, in the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> in their head, until 18 at the time, and they take them from <unk> <unk>
<unk> by the <unk> and <unk> work in silence, doing this task and another time for 16  17 hours a day.
There was no <unk> to eat them and <unk> and <unk> <unk> I was going to be pretty <unk>
As <unk> were the heat and the dust that my camera became too fast to the <unk>
Every 20 minutes I had to run the car to clean the team and make it doing it with them with the <unk> <unk> and sitting there, I think, my camera gets a much better treatment than these people.
I went back in the <unk> I wanted to remember it, but the <unk> that I was on my right-hand side and he said, <unk> I don't do it.
And it explained to me very clearly that I prove emotions is very dangerous in places like this, not only for me but for them.
I could not give you any help to get it.
I couldn't give you money, anything.
I was not aware of that country.
It could put them in a worst situation that they already were.
And I had to trust the <unk> the <unk> and working within the system for the <unk> and <unk> in that <unk>
In the time to me, let me get home to feel my heart <unk>
In the <unk> I found young kids to take rocks for miles by <unk> to the trucks that they were able to get down.
Those big <unk> were more clever than the children who are <unk> and the children are going to get them to their heads with <unk> <unk> made it <unk> and <unk>
It's hard to see something so <unk>
How can we influence something so <unk> but so <unk>
Some of you don't even know that they're <unk> -- and they work 16   17 hours the day without <unk> because this has been all their life.
They don't have nothing with the <unk>
When these <unk> <unk> their freedom, <unk> <unk>
When you hear the obvious word often we often think of the sex traffic and because of this global consciousness to me it would be hard to me to work with security in a particular business.
In <unk> I <unk> women who had been <unk> <unk>
I took me for a couple of <unk> <unk> that did this <unk> <unk> <unk> light <unk>
It wasn't exactly a <unk>
It was more well a restaurant.
<unk> as you know in the <unk> are local to work in <unk>
They have a small rooms in a small rooms where the <unk> <unk> with their girls and kids, some of the only seven years -- they're forced to inspire the clients and <unk> to buy more food and <unk>
Every single place is dark and <unk> <unk> by a <unk> number in the wall and divided by a <unk> and a <unk>
And the workers often suffer for sex <unk> to hands of their <unk>
He's standing in the <unk> I remember to have a sense of fear <unk> and in that time, I barely could imagine what it must be <unk> in that <unk>
I only had a <unk> <unk> <unk>
There was no doors <unk>
There was no big windows like <unk>
Those people don't have <unk> and, because you get a topic so hard, it's important to point that <unk> even the sex traffic is going to us.
There are hundreds of people <unk> in religion in <unk> in the <unk> and the list of the list of it can go on.
First at the New York Times which is that between 100 and 300 children are Americans sold every year as <unk>
It is all of it, but we don't see it.
<unk> are another activity that often are often with the hand of the <unk>
I was working villages in which there were a lot of families in the <unk> of <unk>
This is a family.
<unk> <unk> are the father, the <unk> of blue and <unk>
<unk> <unk> in these big barrels and <unk> the oil in the <unk> to the <unk> but <unk> is <unk>
My <unk> told me their stories.
We don't have <unk>
We have to be able to get out of this house some day and go back to another place where we really will be able to pay our word.
And you have been more than 4,000 children in the lake -- the greatest lake of the world.
When I went to get a quick look at a fast.
I saw what it seemed to be a <unk> family in a boat, two brothers -- some young children has sense of it.
<unk> <unk>
The children are <unk> of their families <unk> <unk> and forced to work to work <unk> in these entrepreneurs in the lake, despite not knowing the <unk>
This boy has eight years.
When our boat went back to me was <unk> subject that his little <unk> was <unk>
I was <unk> by the fear of the <unk>
<unk> branches of the trees in the lake -- they often go into media and kids -- and <unk> and <unk> <unk> to the water for the <unk>
Many <unk>
Since the ones that remember, has always been forced to work on the lake.
From fear of his love is not going to take them and as a whole life has been treated with <unk> <unk> this is the most young <unk>
I met these guys at the five of the morning, when we <unk> the last networks, but they had been working from the one of the one of the one of the one of the one of the one of the one of the one of the one of the one of the one of the one of the one of the one of the one of the one of
In the bottom night and <unk>
And you need to point that these networks are more than 400 kilos when they're <unk>
I want to introduce you to <unk>
It was killed in a village of the <unk>
I met it in a <unk> in the <unk> the <unk> <unk> to victims of <unk>
<unk> is possible.
Who will get to be because somebody decided to make a difference in your life?
<unk> for a road in Ghana with thousands of <unk> the <unk> a <unk> <unk> with her <unk> <unk> and <unk> our car and it takes the window.
They asked them to be <unk> by a land to the <unk>
At the end of the way, we took us to go out of the car, and he asked the driver that he would put it quickly.
And then you signal this path is just visible and said, "This is the way, this is the way.
As we start back to the <unk> we took the <unk> that <unk> the way and after walking close to an hour we found that the road was <unk> by the recent time, so I put the team of pictures about my head to the <unk>
After two hours of <unk> the <unk> road ended up <unk> in one of course, and we had in front of the holes and they had in front of holes that I could sit on a <unk> field and all of them were full of <unk>
A lot of women had children were going to go back to their <unk> and as they were looking at <unk> <unk> in the <unk> <unk>
<unk> is used in the <unk> process.
These <unk> are <unk> in a <unk> in another part of it.
When they came from the <unk> they were <unk> in their own <unk>
I remember that I looked at their eyes <unk> <unk> because many of them had been under land for 72 hours.
<unk> they have to 90 feet and these people who are able to make a lot of <unk> <unk> that then they will be <unk> to another area where you can get up to another area where you can extract the gold.
The first view, the place seems to be filled with men and <unk> but if you look at more <unk> to the <unk> we see some less lucky and also children.
They are all victims of <unk> diseases and violence.
In fact, it's very likely that this <unk> is going to end up as this victim of <unk> and the <unk> in a few years.
So this is <unk> when he died his father his uncle took it to work with him in the <unk>
When I die her <unk> <unk> <unk> the debt of the <unk> what the force is going to be <unk> in conflict.
When I met it, I was working in the <unk> 14 years of the leg that you see here is product of a accident in the <unk> so true that doctors said that I should be <unk>
In addition to that, <unk> it has <unk> and not sequence that is forced to work back night and day in that mine.
Even so he was going to be <unk> and families with the local activists like <unk> the <unk> and it's this kind of set of face to a chance of <unk> which makes me a lot.
I want to take light on the <unk>
Did you know that their images would be seen for you around the world.
I wanted to know that you know that we're going to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to make everything possible to help change their lives.
I don't think if we can act about other as human beings, then it makes it very hard to tolerate it as a <unk>
So these images are not from <unk> are the real people -- people and like me, who deserve the same rights, dignity and respect in their lives.
There is no day that I don't think about these so many other people -- <unk> that I've had the great honor of <unk>
I hope that these images published a force in those who you see, in people like you, and I hope that the force will be able to get a fire and that fire <unk> light on <unk> because without that light, the one of slavery can continue to live in the <unk>
Thank you very much.
I really do math <unk> and there are a huge problem for the <unk> we're like the <unk>
Nobody knows what the hell we do.
So today, I will try to tell you what I do.
<unk> is one of the more human.
We have <unk> the <unk> of the <unk> and the dancers of <unk>  I will see over again.
But the <unk> takes a way of training training -- and probably some of the beginning that you can have an genetic <unk>
And so much of the <unk> disorders like the bad of <unk> <unk> this ability to do it with my friend <unk> <unk> that, in the time, was a <unk> <unk>
In the past years has been made a lot in the treatment.
However, there are <unk> million people in the world that are <unk> and they have to deal with a <unk> <unk> <unk> and other symptoms of this disease, so we need tools to detect the disease before it's too late.
We need to be able to measure the progress in the way, and the only way that we know if you really have a cure to be when we have a <unk> <unk>
But it is <unk> that for the <unk> and other disorders of the movement is not going to react and so they don't use the <unk> and the best thing that we have is a <unk> <unk>
You have to go to a clinic to do it. It's very, very expensive, and that means that outside the clinical trials they never do.
And what if patients could do it in home?
And so that we had a <unk> journey, what if the patients could be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to
They don't need to be.
In the way, it costs about 300 dollars in the <unk>
So what I want to be <unk> as a way it doesn't sound as you can see, in a certain sense at least we are all <unk> like my friend <unk>
This is a video of the <unk> <unk>
It shows somebody healthy as it takes sounds to talk about how we can imagine as a dancers of a <unk> <unk> because we have to coordinate all those organs that to produce sounds and we all have the genes to be <unk>
And as the <unk> requires a extraordinary level.
Let's think about time that brings a child to learn to talk about.
And from the sound, we can take the position of <unk> <unk> as <unk> and as the <unk> it affects the <unk> it also affects the <unk>
In the <unk> <unk> you can see an example of <unk> <unk>
We see the same <unk>
I will get a <unk> and <unk>
The speech becomes more <unk> and <unk> after a while, and this is an example of <unk>
How do you take these <unk> <unk> in the voice with the clinical trials -- Well, they're both not <unk>
The <unk> <unk> is not <unk> both use the social infrastructure.
We don't need to design all a whole whole series of hospitals to do.
They both are <unk> Well, but also the ability to be <unk>
I mean, you can be <unk>
They make very fast they take about 30 seconds as a lot.
These are <unk> cost and we all know what happens happened.
And when something is a cost so <unk> it comes to massive scale.
So these are some incredible goals in order to get away.
We can reduce the difficulties <unk>
I don't ask to go to the clinic for <unk>
With high often we could be able to get data data.
We could make the massive <unk> of under clinical trials and by the first time, <unk> <unk> to scale to scale.
We have the opportunity to start looking for the first <unk> of disease before it's too late.
So to give you the first steps in that sense, we are <unk> the <unk> <unk> <unk>
<unk> to <unk> and <unk> we want to get a huge amount of voices around the world to collect enough data and start to address these goals.
We have the local lines for a few billion people in the world.
<unk> with or <unk> you can call it under the price and let me show me that we have reached the <unk> of the goal in just eight hours.
Thank you.     So I would take all these samples to take all of these samples -- let's say 10 people, you can say, who are healthy and who is not a healthy and who right?
What do you take from these <unk>
Max <unk> Yeah, what happens is that it happens is that it is that it is that it is that you have or not the disease.
<unk> you see, some people can do not <unk> it may not be <unk>
But we're going to get a very big sample of data <unk> in different circumstances and do it in different circumstances is important because we're looking for the factors of confusion in the power of the disease.
TR: They have a <unk> <unk> in this time.
<unk> much more than that.
In fact, my student <unk> I have to <unk> it has done a fantastic work and now has shown that works in the network of mobile cell -- also, what we do -- the project now we have 70 percent of farmers.
TR: <unk> <unk> Well, it's a <unk>
<unk> of course.
TR: Thank you very much. Max <unk>
<unk> Thank you, <unk>
Before 23 percent of 2011, I did <unk> <unk> in the city of New York.
We are <unk> creatures.
We put them on the darkness, in <unk> without windows and the general, we have the light light.
We make the <unk> models still more <unk> the perfect skin still still more perfect we do it, it possible and we get them on the press all the time but some of us are really artists with talent with many years of experience and a real sense of the images and the picture.
The 11 of October of 2011, I saw from my house, as the rest of the world, the <unk> events that we will think in Japan.
Shortly time later, a organization where the organization was <unk> <unk> <unk> was in the place working as part of the <unk>
I was along with hundreds of other volunteers we knew that we can't be able to keep sitting in home, so I decided to take the group for three weeks ago.
The 13 of May I went to <unk>
It's a small village in the <unk> <unk> of almost 50 people, one of the first villages -- one of the first villages affected by the <unk>
The level of water is going to get more than 24 feet and more than three miles inside.
As you can imagine, the village was <unk>
We get <unk> of the channels and <unk>
<unk> schools, <unk> <unk> and we leave the <unk> houses to be <unk> and <unk>
We have tons of tons and tons of fish <unk> <unk> <unk> of the local market.
We were <unk> and they did.
For weeks, so many of the volunteers like the neighbors found things like to be similar.
They found pictures of pictures of photos and cameras and <unk> <unk>
They all did the same.
<unk> and giving them different places of the villages of around around the <unk>
It wasn't until so I realized that those pictures are a huge part of the personal losses that people had <unk>
As a <unk> of the <unk> and to save their lives, they had to leave it absolutely everything that they do.
At the end of my first week I started to help help help be a <unk> center of the village.
It was going to look at the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
This place it turned out to be also the place of the village where the center of <unk> <unk> the photos.
There are the <unk> and I had the honor that that day <unk> in me to clean the photos.
This was exciting and <unk> I had heard the expression to think about the <unk> but it wasn't until I had a lot of my <unk> that something happened.
When you look at the pictures, I found some more than a hundred years of a few years ago they were still in the lab, I couldn't help help be thinking about how to fix that <unk> how to fix that <unk> and I knew hundreds of people who could do the same.
So that night I went on Facebook, I went to some of them, and the morning the answer was so <unk> and a little morning that I knew we had to think about.
So we started <unk> the photos.
This was the first of all.
I was not too <unk> but where the water had <unk> the face of the girl had <unk> with a lot of accuracy and <unk>
On the other way, that little girl would not have the aspect of the time, and that would be so fascinating.
With the step of the time, they have been more pictures and it takes more <unk> so I went back back on Facebook, and <unk> and five days later 80 people from 12 countries were offered to help.
At two weeks ago, I had 150 people from <unk>
In Japan, in Japan, we took them to <unk> a village to come back to the <unk> of <unk>
Once I was able to use our scanner in religious libraries that they had <unk> where people were going to bring their photos.
And the time that <unk> in <unk> is a different story on the <unk> of the photos.
I was able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to perform a few weeks ago.
It was a few months.
This <unk> he had to be able to draw a lot of your hand using the areas that color and detail and the water had no <unk>
I took a long time.
The water destroyed all of these pictures of the water <unk> in the bacteria, they covered with bacteria, and even with <unk> all of it along with the step of the time, I keep <unk> by that <unk>
We can't take the picture at least that was <unk> <unk> and had been <unk> by her <unk>
We had lucky with <unk>
We choose to get them with a <unk>
It's very easy to lead it even more the pictures of <unk>
As he said, <unk> the leader of my group is like to make a <unk>
You can't make mistakes.
The woman who brought us these pictures have been lucky to the photos.
I had started <unk> it was the same but they stopped the realize that the <unk> even more.
I also had <unk>
Without them, the images of his husband and the face of their own face would not have been able to test the images in a single picture and <unk> the whole picture.
When I got their pictures to make something of your story with us.
A bunch of colleagues found the pictures in a <unk> station, between the <unk> in a <unk> station, in which I used to be his house, but their colleagues were <unk>
The day of the tsunami, his husband was the <unk> of the <unk> the barriers to the <unk>
It had to go within the water as the <unk> <unk>
Your children were not so small now, but their two children were in the school, in different animals.
One of them grew up in the water.
I took a week to find a week to find all their family and knowing that they all had been born.
And the day that I was going to get their pictures the extra son of the average son at 14 years.
For all, despite all of this, those pictures were the best gift that I could <unk> something that he could remember the last day that I could remember on the past day when everything in their life changed or it was <unk>
After six months in Japan <unk> volunteers had come up in the <unk> and hundreds of them have helped us to look at the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> <unk> the great <unk> -- the great majority came into their <unk> <unk>
More than 500 volunteers around the world has helped us to go back to 90 families hundreds of <unk> and <unk>
For this time, we really don't spend more than a half billion and materials, most of the <unk> most of the <unk>
We take pictures of it.
A picture is a remember of somebody or something, one of all, a relationship, somebody said,
They are <unk> of our memories and stories, the last thing that we have to do but the first thing that we were going to look for.
So this was the project, to restore small pieces of humanity, to bring somebody in the past.
When a picture like this is giving somebody, a huge difference in the life of the person that you know.
This is also a big difference in the life of the <unk>
In some of them with a few of them with something more big, to bring something, using their talent for something that are not going to be very perfect models.
And so to end me like to read this email <unk> he sent it to the day I went back from Japan after six months.
As a <unk> I couldn't help help help be thinking about people and the stories we put in the images.
A in particular, a particular picture with women from the grandmother to the grandmother to the grandmother to the grandmother to the grandmother until a baby girl -- and a short picture of my family my grandmother, my mother, my mother, and my daughter, <unk> <unk>
In the human world in all the few our basic world are <unk> right?
Thank you.
<unk> <unk> led us to me, and curious with this picture of a joke that took an apple in a exhibition of just an exhibition of a second.
But now, 50 years later, we can go a million times faster and see the world not a million or a billion or a billion <unk> a second.
I present a new type of <unk> the <unk> a new technique that can create videos in <unk> <unk> <unk>
And with that we can create cameras that you can see after the <unk> of the red line or see the inside of the body of vision, or you see the inside of the body of <unk>
If I take a laser <unk> and I went back and <unk> in a second <unk> or <unk> in several <unk> to create a <unk> <unk> <unk>
And that <unk> <unk> that <unk> to travel to the speed of light, and again, a million times faster than a common.
If we take that <unk> and this <unk> <unk> and <unk> in this <unk> How do you take those <unk> within this <unk>
What's the aspect of light in <unk>
Now, all of this --   I remember that all this happens in less than a <unk> is what it takes in to travel the light.
But this video is 10 billion times more <unk> so that you can see light in movement.
<unk> <unk> this research --  <unk> many things in this <unk> <unk> this information to show what's going on.
<unk> our <unk> goes on the bottle with a <unk> <unk> which starts to <unk> and that, where you start <unk>
Some of the light is <unk> it goes to the table, and we started seeing these <unk>
A lot of the <unk> eventually come up and then they put them in several directions.
As you can see, there is a air bubble that extends on the inside.
In that time, the waves of the table and because of the <unk> of the top of the top of the <unk> you see in the bottom of the <unk> after a number of pictures, that <unk> <unk>
Now, if we take a common individual, and we do it to make the same distance and we see the same distance and we see it to about 10 billion times, how much they think that we would take us sitting to see that issue.
A day? It is actually all a year.
It would be a very wonderful film --  <unk> <unk>
And what can we test with nature <unk>
You can see the waves of the table of the table and the wall of the wall.
It's like <unk> a <unk> in a microscope.
It's the way that nature takes a picture, I thought of a <unk> at the time, but of course, our eyes see a <unk>
But if you look at a more this, you realize that as the light is <unk> of the <unk> <unk> <unk>
Why? Because the <unk> is <unk> and the light <unk> in its inside and it goes back after several <unk> of a second.
In the future, when this <unk> is in your cell phones are going to be able to go to the <unk> and you know, if the <unk> is <unk> without having to <unk>
So what we create this camera in the <unk>
As you say, you know, if we take a picture to low <unk> it goes very a little bit of a light here.
But we're going to get a thousand million times faster than the <unk> <unk> so you just get something of light.
So we got that <unk> that <unk> and <unk> millions of times, and we put up and again, and again with a very <unk> <unk> we took those <unk> data and <unk> <unk> to create those <unk>
We can take all of those data in <unk> and <unk> in a interesting way.
It can fly.
Other heroes can become <unk>
And if a new power of a <unk> future would be able to see after the <unk>
The idea is that we could take something of light on the door. It will go into the room, a part is going to focus on the door, and from there until the camera, the camera, to the camera, as well.
And where we could extract those multiple <unk> of light.
It's not science that we've built it.
The left, is our <unk>
On the wall there is a <unk> and <unk> light on the door.
After the <unk> of our article in <unk> <unk>
And a small fraction of the <unk> will go back to the camera -- but interestingly, in very different time.
And as we have a camera that works as fast our <unk> has <unk>
It has very good <unk> and you can look at the world to the speed of light.
So we know the way to the door to the door and also until the <unk> objects but we don't know what it was going away.
At the project, a laser can record a picture in <unk> that, you see in the screen it really doesn't have any sense.
But we take a lot of images like this, tens of images, the <unk> and we will try to look at the multiple <unk> of light, and with that, we can see the object <unk>
We can see it in <unk>
This is our <unk>
We have things to explore before we take this to the laboratory, but in the future, we could create cars that <unk> <unk> with what's going to go back from the <unk>
And we could look looking at the <unk> conditions in the light of the light of the <unk>
And we could build <unk> you able to see the inside of the body <unk> and the same for the <unk>
But of course, because of the tissue and the blood of this is pretty hard, so it is pretty hard, so it's actually a asked scientists to start thinking about the <unk> as a new way of visualization to solve the problems of <unk>
So as <unk> <unk> he became a scientist, it became the science of <unk>
I realized that all the <unk> of data that we collect every time they're not just for <unk> <unk> but we can see it.
We create a new form of photograph with <unk> <unk>
And let's look at those cells, the time between every one of those waves is just a few of the <unk>
But here's something fun.
If you look at the waves under the <unk> these <unk>
<unk> they should move to us.
What happens here?
It turns out that, as we are recording almost about the speed of light, we have <unk> <unk> would be willing to see this image.
The order that happen in the world in the world in the world in the world in the world is actually invested in the camera.
<unk> the <unk> of space and time, we can be <unk> this <unk>
It's not time. Thank you.
Hi. This is my cell phone.
A phone can take the life, and gives you the individual person.
With a phone can <unk> a crime.
With a cell phone can inspire a message and start a <unk> in Egypt.
With a phone you can record a song, <unk> <unk> and <unk>
All this is possible with a cell phone.
I'm a <unk> <unk> and live in the city of <unk>
Let's go back to that moment, to this city.
And here you can see how hundreds of thousands of thousands of people are going to be able to be able to get a change.
This is the <unk> <unk> if all of these people who are able to be able to be able to be able to be a phone in the pocket.
Who is that of the <unk> they have a phone here?
<unk>
Raise your cell phone.
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
It's a lot of you all have a cell phone.
But today today to talk about me, and how I changed the life.
I'm going to talk about this.
These are 35 percent of information.
<unk>
Why is that information there?
Because in the summer of 2006, the <unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk> <unk>
This guy says that every single company that every single company was the Internet in the Internet of all Europe, it has to get a huge range of information from the power.
Who is called <unk> who would send a friend of <unk>
Who would send them a <unk>
And if you use the phone where we are.
All of this information goes on at least six months, and until two years ago, in his phone company or its <unk>
And in all Europe people came up and said, "I don't want to explain this."
They said they didn't want to do this <unk> of data.
We want the <unk> in the digital age and we don't want to have the Americans and the <unk> <unk> all this information about us.
There was <unk> <unk> <unk> all they said, "I don't want to do?"
And here you can see about ten people who came into the streets of <unk> and they said, <unk> <unk>
And some even told that this would be the <unk>
The <unk> was the secret police of Germany in France.
And I also asked me if this works.
You can get all this information about us?
Every time they use the <unk>
So I asked my <unk> <unk> <unk> that in that time, was the greatest company in Germany, which is why they <unk> all the information that was about me.
I asked them a time, and I went back to you, and I didn't have a particular answer -- it was all the <unk>
But then I said, I want to have this information because you are <unk> my life.
So I decided to <unk> a <unk> <unk> because I wanted to have this information.
But <unk> <unk> said, no, you don't give you this information.
At the end of the end of <unk>
<unk> the demand and they send me the information that I <unk>
Meanwhile, the <unk> <unk> <unk> did the <unk> for the <unk> law of the <unk>
So I received this ugly about <unk> with a <unk>
And in the <unk> there was this.
Four and five thousand <unk> a lot of information.
At the beginning I saw it, and I said, well, it's a huge object.
But after a time I realized it's my life.
There are six months of my life in this <unk>
It was a little bit <unk> what I should do with that?
Because you can see where I am, where the night, what I'm doing.
But then I said, I want this information <unk>
I want to make it public again.
Because I want to show you people what is the <unk> of data.
So along the <unk> <unk> and we saw it <unk> and we did this.
This is a visualization of six months of my life.
You can go back and try to go back and go back.
You can see every step that I do.
And you can see how to <unk> in the train <unk> and how often I call it in the way.
All this is possible with this information.
That day a little bit of fear.
But it's not just about me.
It's all of us.
First, there are things like, I call my wife, and she said, let's talk about a couple of times.
And then they call me some friends and they call them between them.
And then you call the other, and the other at the other, and we ended up with this big network.
You can see how their people are being connected to each other, what time they call about each other to what time you can.
You can see all of it.
You can see the <unk> the leaders.
If you have access to this information, you can see what's doing society.
If you have access to this information, you can control their society.
This is a model for countries like China and Iran.
This is a model to study the way of your society, because you know who talk about who I talk about <unk> who do you take a friend of <unk> all this is possible if you have access to this information.
And this data goes on at least six months in Europe, and until two years.
As I said at the beginning, imagine if all these people in the streets of <unk> in <unk> in 1989, they had a phone on the pocket.
And the <unk> would have known who was in this tradition, and if the <unk> had known who were the leaders who were the leaders, this would never have happened.
The one of the <unk> <unk> perhaps never had happened.
And in a child, I don't get the every of the <unk> <unk>
Because today, the military agencies and companies want to get so much information of us as possible within the website.
They want to have the chance to keep our lives and they want to get it forever.
But the <unk> and live in the digital age is not a contradiction.
But today, you have to fight the <unk>
You have to fight that every day.
When they go home to their friends that religion is a value of the 20th century, and it's not the entire time.
When you're going to go home, <unk> to their <unk> that just because companies and the military agencies can get some information, they don't have to do it.
And if I don't believe me to ask your company -- what information are <unk>
So in the future, every time you use their cell phones to get them to remember that they have to fight the <unk> in the age of digital age.
Thank you.
Hello, <unk> what happens?
It's not enough.
Hello, <unk> what happens?
I call it <unk> <unk> and I'm not <unk> but I know the doctor who brought me to the world.
I took my mom six times in six different different different different different different different different different different different different different different different different.
As a result, I have to care about the <unk> all the time.
<unk>
It's <unk> I'm like a <unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk> is not genetic
It's not <unk> no <unk>
No one <unk> the <unk> of my mother and not the <unk> because my parents was <unk> brothers, although they are.
It's only about accidents, as the one that happened to me at it.
Now, I'm going to be <unk> I'm not <unk> and I don't want any of the right there.
I feel bad for me, because in some time of life, have made it to be <unk>
We're going to walk.
<unk> <unk> are in the center of the <unk> and they go into a bunch of <unk> and what you can.
16 different places for <unk>
And they say, "Oh, I can be at least a little bit of <unk>
In addition, I say, I have 99 problems, and the <unk> is just one of them.
There's a <unk> of the <unk> I took the <unk> of gold.
I am <unk> <unk> woman, I live in New Jersey.
If you don't feel better, you might do it.
I am <unk> <unk> in New Jersey.
I always loved my neighborhood and my disease had the same <unk>
I love that if I want to walk out of my house to New York, I would be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to get my home to New York,
A lot of people with <unk> <unk> but my parents don't believe in the <unk> <unk>
And the <unk> of my father was, "Can you <unk> <unk> <unk>
If my three <unk> <unk> <unk>
If my three African sisters were going to high school to the public school -- my parents <unk> the school system and <unk> that I was also <unk> and if you don't take all the view of my mom.
My father taught me to walk back to the five years to put my <unk> in their feet and just just crying.
Another thing that used was a dollar in front of me for the <unk>
The <unk> that I have within it was very strong as well.
Yeah. The first day in the front of the front of the front of the <unk> was like a <unk> <unk> which has received many <unk>
And when you grow only six years in my city and they were all of the family.
Now there are 20 <unk> and they're still all of the family.  I think nobody realized we were not <unk>
This was before the Pete and the politicians would be able to be able to be able to use <unk> to <unk> <unk>
People who grew up with the people who grew up with my faith.
But it seemed to be <unk> a lot of <unk> for the <unk>
I said that I was enough to live a enough to live three months without <unk> so that <unk> of the <unk> is very easy.
<unk> <unk> in <unk>
Yeah, in <unk> it's crazy.  My parents couldn't afford the physical therapy, so I gave me to the school school.
I learned with <unk> or I can walk with <unk>
I am in New Jersey and there we want to be <unk> so if my friends used <unk> I can use it.
And when my friends were going to go up the summer of summer in the Pacific coast I didn't know.
I spent my <unk> in a war, because my parents were worried that if you don't go to <unk> all of the <unk> we were <unk> in <unk>
In the middle of summer, often my father was about <unk> so I would buy <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> on the <unk> and I remember that the water was <unk> the eyes and I thought, <unk> <unk>
But the <unk> cure was <unk>
I have to say that it's very excited but before it would do it was a <unk> <unk> that I couldn't get <unk> <unk> <unk>
And now I can <unk> in the head.
My parents <unk> this idea that I could do any thing, that no dream was impossible, and my dream was being in the <unk> <unk>
I went to college through the <unk> <unk> and I got a <unk> for the <unk> University.
It was like <unk> <unk>
All of me <unk>
I did all the tasks of the least smart tasks I took the <unk> in my <unk> and also in their <unk>
Every time I did a scene of <unk> my teachers <unk>
But I never got a paper.
And then finally, in my last year, the <unk> decided to make a work called <unk> <unk>
It's a work of a girl with <unk>
I was a girl with <unk>
So I started walking to the four <unk> <unk> end up to have a <unk>
I have <unk>
At the end of the end of <unk>
Thank God <unk> I am <unk>
I didn't have the paper.  He gave them <unk>
I went to <unk> <unk> at the middle of the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> as if somebody had gone to my cat, to ask me why and she told me that because they think that they couldn't do the <unk>
And I said, <unk> if I can't do the <unk> <unk> you can't do the <unk>
It was a paper for that he literally was born and they gave him a company without <unk>
I was <unk> my life.
Hollywood has a <unk> story of <unk> actors in the <unk>
When I went back to home, and my first <unk> was as extra in a <unk>
My dream made it true.
And I knew it would be <unk> from <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> in a <unk>
In change, there is there like a <unk> I don't see more than the <unk> and it was clear for me to me that the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
It's just <unk> people.
But there were close to the rule.
I grew up watching <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and all these women had a thing in common.
So I did it <unk>
In my first <unk> took the famous famous of New York to New Jersey and never forget the face of the first <unk> that took when he turned back when he realized that I was going to high speed on the New York <unk>
I worked in <unk> of all the United States, and also in <unk> in the Middle East, without <unk> and without <unk>
Some people say I'm the first <unk> of the Arab world.
I never like to give you the first place, but I know that they never heard that small <unk> which says that women are not excited and we find very fun.
In 2003, my brother of another mother and father, Bob <unk> and I took the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> of New York, now in his 10.
Our goal was to change the <unk> image of the <unk> in the media.
<unk> <unk> was a lot more easy to fight against the challenge of <unk>
My big opportunity came in 2010.
I went to me at the <unk> program, it has come back with Keith <unk>
I went on as if it was to a <unk> <unk> I took me to a study, and I sat on a <unk>
I saw the <unk> and I said, <unk> you can give you another <unk>
She looked at me and he looked at four, three, <unk>
And we were in <unk>
So I took me to the desk of the <unk> to not get out of the screen of the screen for the <unk> and when I ended up the <unk> was <unk>
At the end of my time I had my opportunity and the <unk> I knew that they didn't get to me.
But not only the Mr. <unk> became a <unk> but it turned out as a little bit about a complete time and <unk> my <unk>
Something that I learned in <unk> with Keith <unk> was that people in the Internet are <unk>
It says that kids are <unk> but they never get out of me or a little girl or <unk>
And suddenly my business in the Internet became <unk>
<unk> <unk> in the line with <unk> like, "Why do you do?"
"It's <unk>
And my <unk> <unk> <unk>
What disease does it be?
We really should be <unk>
A <unk> <unk> even that I would remember my childhood <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
<unk> is so visual as the race.
If somebody in <unk> you can't do <unk> then you can't make somebody in <unk>
<unk> are <unk> Yeah, <unk> man.
The <unk> are the most big danger of the world, and the more <unk> in the world of the world.
The doctors said that I don't <unk> but I'm here in front of you.
However, we have grown with the media.
I hope that together we can create more greater images of disability in the media and in life.
Maybe if you have more <unk> images that <unk> less hatred in the Internet.
Or maybe not.
Maybe we still need all the whole society to teach our children.
My <unk> <unk> has led me to very impressive.
I went to <unk> by the red carpet <unk> by the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk>
I went to act in a film with Adam <unk> and working with my <unk> the incredible Dave <unk>
<unk> the world <unk> <unk> have become <unk>
I was <unk> on the big state of New York in the <unk> of 2008.
And I took <unk>
It was the only time that my father was able to act in alive, and I do this talk to your memory.
<unk> in peace, <unk>
I call it <unk> <unk> and if I can play you can.
I'd like to tell you a story about a small village.
I don't know her name, but I know it.
And it lives in a small village in a small village in <unk>
This people are close to <unk>
<unk> drives the small village to poverty and <unk>
Without nothing for him there, it's going to the big city in this case, <unk> the capital of <unk>
When it comes there, there is no people -- there are no work, no work, and no <unk>
He just live in a <unk> in the city of <unk>
After a year <unk> anything.
A day is about a gentleman that gives you to get it up to <unk> after <unk>
They're also going to be a group group of people, which gives a <unk>
It gets a little bit of money to get a little bit of money to send their money to send them home, to his family.
I showed a young one.
I finally got home.
It starts a new life.
It has a sense of life.
A beautiful day in <unk> under a blue sky <unk> a bomb.
That boy of that small village with dreams of the great city was the <unk> <unk> and that group of people were in the <unk> a terrorist organization with the <unk>
So how the story of a small town of a small village trying to get their dreams in the city on the city on the city on the city on the city on the city on the city came up with him <unk>
He was <unk>
I was waiting for an opportunity, waiting to start their future, waiting to a view of future, and this was the first thing that it comes.
This was the first thing that he took it from what we call the <unk>
And the story is happening in urban centers around the world.
It's the story of the <unk> young city that <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> in London, that they get something beyond the <unk> <unk>
For young people, the promise that the promise of the city, the great dream of the city is the one of the opportunity, but the young people aren't involved in the prosperity of their cities.
It's often the doctors who have been from the highest rates of <unk>
For 2030, three of every five people who live in cities will be under 18 years.
If we don't find young people in the growth of our cities, if you don't get them to <unk> the story of the <unk> <unk> the door of access to the food of access to violence to the <unk> to be the story of the cities.
And in my city of <unk> <unk> 70 percent of the young is <unk>
70 percent is not going to go to school.
They don't make pretty much anything.
I went to <unk> the month, and I went to visit the <unk> <unk> the hospital where I was born.
I remember to be at that hospital <unk> to <unk> thinking, and if I never had to me.
And if I had seen me forced to be in that same <unk> of <unk>
It would have become <unk>
I'm not really sure about the answer.
The reason I was in <unk> that month was actually in <unk> to a few leaders in a business rate.
<unk> to about 90 leaders.
We sit up and we had a carbon of ideas about the solutions to the big challenges that face the city.
One of the young people in the room was <unk>
He was at the University of <unk> <unk>
There was no work, not opportunity.
I remember when he remember when he was a college student -- <unk> <unk> was the perfect white for Al <unk> and other organizations <unk> to be <unk>
They were people like it.
But this story takes a different way.
In <unk> the biggest obstacle to get the <unk>
<unk> years of civil war have completely destroyed the <unk> system and a <unk> can be the most easy way to <unk>
<unk> saw an opportunity and <unk>
He started a <unk> company.
They started <unk> <unk> the local income who they usually couldn't be <unk>
I took 10 <unk> with the help of his family and friends, and his dream is in some point to build hundreds of <unk> for the next three years.
Why is different this story?
What do you do this story about this.
I think the ability to identify and take a new opportunity.
It's the <unk> spirit and I think the human spirit can be the most powerful tool against the <unk>
<unk> the young people to be the <unk> of the economic opportunities that are looking for as well.
And you can train people to be entrepreneurs.
I want to tell you about a young man who went to one of my <unk> <unk> <unk> a <unk>
I was <unk> to train a few of the young people in the speed of the business and how it will be <unk> and how to create a culture of business projects.
In fact, it's the first <unk> that <unk> has seen over 22 years old, and until a little bit recently, until you wanted flowers to your <unk> <unk> we were from plastic <unk>
If you ask somebody, you do the last time that you saw flowers <unk>
So those who grew up for the war, the answer would be <unk>
So, you saw a opportunity.
They started a <unk> company and design <unk>
I created a farm in the outside of <unk> and began to grow <unk> and <unk> that it could survive the hard climate <unk>
And they started the <unk> of flowers to measure them in the homes, and the companies of the city, and now it's working on the creation of the first park <unk> <unk> in 22 years.
There are no public sector in <unk>
It wants to create a space where the families, young people can go together, and as he says, "You know, <unk> <unk>
By the way, he didn't make it <unk> because they use a lot of water.
So the first step is to inspire young people, and in that room, the presence of <unk> had a really profound impact in young people.
They never thought to start a single business.
They had thought to work for a <unk> to work for the government, but its story, their innovation really had a strong impact about them.
I took them to look at their city as a place of opportunity.
<unk> to believe that might be <unk> that might be <unk> that might be <unk>
For the end of the day, they had sex solutions for some of the biggest challenges that face the city.
<unk> solutions for local problems.
So inspire the young people and create a culture of spirit culture is really a great step, but the young need to do their ideas to do their ideas.
They need experience and free to <unk> in the development and put them into their business.
<unk> the young people with the resources that they need, <unk> the support that they need to move from the conception of creation, and create <unk> for economic growth.
For me, the business spirit is something more than we start a business.
It's creating a social impact.
It's not just selling <unk>
I think it's selling hope.
Your Park, of <unk> is how it says, when it's creating the way people see their city.
<unk> <unk> children from the street to help you eat and to keep the <unk> for it.
I gave them the opportunity to escape the <unk> of <unk>
These young girls are having a tremendous impact in their cities.
So my <unk> is, it's going to be the young people in <unk> <unk> and <unk> its <unk> innovation and you have more stories about flowers and <unk> <unk> and <unk>
Thank you.
I was about ten years old, and I went to <unk> with my father in the mountains <unk> a <unk> area in northern New York.
It was a beautiful day.
<unk> <unk>
The sun was that the leaves was <unk> as a <unk> and not being the way that we were <unk> we were the first human beings, we were the first human humans in the land.
We got to our camp.
It was a <unk> in a <unk> with a beautiful lake <unk> when I discovered something boring <unk>
After the <unk> there was a <unk> of about four feet on the hearts of apple <unk> balls and <unk> and <unk>
And I was <unk> I was very excited and incredibly <unk>
The <unk> who were too <unk> as to take what they thought I was going to clean their <unk>
That question went to me, and you get a little bit.
Who is the <unk>
No matter as <unk> or where the <unk> the <unk> who is the <unk>
Who look at our <unk> in Rio or <unk> or <unk>
So here in New York, the Department of <unk> is our <unk> in the reason of 11 tons of <unk> and two tons of products -- every day.
I wanted to know as individuals.
I wanted to understand who that work.
What feels like to use the Amazon and take that <unk>
So I started a research project with them.
I grew up in the trucks and walked out by their interactions, and I met people in <unk> and the whole city in the entire city, and I learned a lot, but it still was a <unk>
I need to get more.
So I started working as <unk> <unk>
Now I didn't just grew up in <unk>
And we heard the <unk> <unk> and <unk>
It was a really privilege of privilege and a easy thing.
They all ask about the smell.
It's there, but it's not as well as I believe, and in the days that it's very strong you can be <unk>
It costs a lot of <unk>
I met people who had worked in that for several years and their bodies were able to bring them into the weight of taking on their body tons of <unk> every weeks ago.
It's also the danger.
According to the <unk> of <unk> <unk> <unk> is one of the ten <unk> and I learned the right.
You're going to go up and entering the traffic all day and they go back to you.
They just want to be <unk> so it is not paying attention.
That's very bad for the <unk>
And also the <unk> in it is full of the fact that they often fall out of the truck and <unk> damage to me.
I also learned about the <unk> <unk>
When you go out of the <unk> and you see a city from the <unk> part of the truck, you can understand that the <unk> is like a force of nature on it.
Never leave them to come.
It's also like a <unk> form or <unk>
It's always being in movement.
And it's also <unk>
It seems to be that the <unk> is especially enough because I think that the <unk> <unk> are the more important hand in the streets of the city for three reasons.
They're the first <unk> of public health.
If you don't get them out of the <unk> and effective as the day, this starts to <unk> from their <unk> and their <unk> will be able to focus in very real ways.
So we could take it for decades, for decades and centuries they come back and start <unk>
The economy the needs.
If we can't get out of the old of the old we don't have space for the new way that the engines of the economy are starting to focus when it's in danger the <unk>
I'm not <unk> by 1900, I just write their relationship.
And then it's what I call our average speed of <unk>
With that I mean, just to the speed that we were able to move in the time.
You know, we don't get <unk> or <unk> <unk> or we took them with us our cup of coffee, our bag of water.
<unk> <unk> we forget about them, because we know that there are a job force on the other side of it.
So today, I want to get a couple of ways to think about the <unk> <unk> that maybe help reduce the <unk> and <unk> in that conversation about how to design a <unk> city and human city.
Your work, I think, is almost <unk>
They're in the street every day of <unk>
They use a <unk> in many cities.
Do you know when <unk>
And their work allows us to do it.
They're almost a way of <unk>
The flow that they keep us to get us to care of our own <unk> our <unk> our <unk> and that flow always must keep a way or another.
A day after 11 September September September the <unk> of a <unk> walked on the street, and I took my little child, and there was a guy doing her <unk> <unk> and there was a guy doing her <unk> <unk>
And I tried to be able to make their work that day in particular, but I started crying.
And I looked at me and just <unk> and he said, "Let's be okay.
We're going to be <unk>
Shortly after that I started looking at the <unk> and I went to see that man.
It's called <unk> we work together so many times and we did it.
I want to believe that <unk> I was right.
We're going to be okay.
But in our efforts for <unk> the way we think in this planet as a species we need to get up and have to realize all the food -- even the real cost of your play.
<unk> <unk> what we think when we talk about <unk> represent the three of the amount of <unk>
It's an remarkable.
So in the flow of their days and their lives, the next thing you see somebody who work is clean the <unk> of you, <unk> a moment to <unk>
<unk> a moment to tell you thank you.
My work is based on the connection to think about our medical life to get part of the environment where architecture is actually focused from the conditions and local power.
I took two projects like example of this.
Both projects are sitting in countries in Ethiopia and the other in Tunisia.
They can also share the fact that the different analysis of different <unk> become a essential part of the work of architecture.
The first example started with a invitation to design a <unk> center in the capital of <unk> <unk> <unk>
This is the kind of building that showed us as example, my team and me, about what we had to happen.
At first, the first thing that I thought was, I want to get <unk>
After seeing some of these buildings are many in the city we realized that there are three important aspects to <unk>
In the beginning, these buildings are almost <unk> because they have a very big <unk> where people can't be able to buy things.
Second, you need to make a lot of energy because the <unk> <unk> generates heat in the <unk> so it's necessary a lot of <unk>
In a city where this is not going to happen because it's about a <unk> climate of 20 to 25 degrees for all the year.
And in third of all, its aspect has nothing to see with Africa or Ethiopia.
It's a little bit of a very rich place in culture.
In our first visit in our first visit in Ethiopia, I was actually thrilled with the ancient market that is this structure the air of the air of the <unk> where thousands of people, go and buy things all the days of small <unk>
There is also that idea of using the public space to generate green activity.
And so I thought, that that was what I really wanted to design not a <unk>
But the question was how to build a green <unk> building <unk> these principles.
The next challenge is led to the <unk> the place, which is sitting in a long area of the city, where a great part of the buildings that we now see in the image, not exist.
And it's also twice between two streets that are not willing to communicate in a <unk> of hundreds of feet.
So the first thing we did was to create a connection between these two streets, they take all the <unk> of the building.
And it turns out with a <unk> <unk> that creates a space in the building of the building in the building which is <unk> by its own way, the sun and <unk>
And around this space we've got the idea of the marketplace with small business, which changes in every floor because of the way of space.
I also thought, how to close the <unk>
And I wanted to find a solution that we were going to be <unk> to the very local conditions.
And I put me to think about a clinical tissue to a <unk> <unk> with <unk> to allow them to the car entrance and also the light, but of a <unk>
Then we put them on these beautiful buttons from the <unk> of the <unk>
They have properties of geometry geometry, and this helped me access the <unk>
We are building that with these small pieces that are the windows that they leave the air and light on a way on the inside of the building.
This is <unk> with these small <unk> of colors that they use light on the building of the building to light the building for the night.
With these ideas it didn't feel easy to convince them, because they thought, "That's not a <unk> center was not what they <unk>
But in all, we all realized that this idea of the market was being much more effective than the <unk> center because of the end of the <unk> there was more local for it.
And also the idea of the <unk> was a lot more effective not only because of the material compared to the glass, but also because it wasn't not necessary to have the air.
So we get certain space in the budget that we use to create the project.
The first thing was thinking about how to get the <unk> of energy for the building in a city where the electricity is just just every day.
So we get a big advantage to put <unk> on the roof.
And then under those panels we think about the roof as a new space with a new space with <unk> areas that would use this <unk>
And these <unk> in the roof, that we can use water for <unk>
It is waiting for the beginning of the next year, because we're going to go through the fifth floor of building the model.
The second example is a gay plan of 2000 and services in the city of Tunisia.
And to make a very large project the biggest thing that I have <unk> I needed not just understand the city of <unk> but also to its environment, their tradition and culture.
For that analysis I put special special in the <unk> a structure of 1,000 years of the <unk> that was surrounded by a wall with a wall of access to access to <unk>
When I went to the place, the first operation that we did was to expand the streets to be able to be able to get a lot of three different blocks similar on the size and features that there are in <unk> and other cities in Europe with these <unk>
In addition to that, we choose some of the <unk> points in relationship with the idea of the doors and the idea of the doors and this is the idea of the <unk>
And the last operation was thinking about the cell, the small cell cell of the project, as the <unk> as a essential part of the plan,
I thought, what would be the best honest for a <unk> in the climate change.
And it's <unk> that creates a <unk> difference between both sides of the house and so much a natural virus.
So you get a problem that we recognize that most of the apartments are perfectly <unk> in that direction.
And this is the result that it's almost like a combination of the local block and the urban city.
It has these blocks with <unk> and then in the <unk> plant we have all the connections to <unk>
And it also responds to the local rules that they create a greater density in the other levels and a less less on the <unk>
And they also make this idea of the <unk>
The roof, which is my favorite space of the project is almost almost like giving it to the community of the space space for building the building space.
It's where all the neighbors, you can go and <unk> and make activities such as a half miles on the morning, or <unk> from a building to another day.
These two sounds have a common approach in the design process.
And also, they're in developing countries where you can see the cities literally grow.
In these cities, the impact of architecture in the life of people changes in the living communities and economies in the same rate that they grow buildings.
For this reason, I see even more important to look at the architecture looking for bad solutions but <unk> that they get the relationship between the community and the environment that they have to connect the nature with people.
Thank you very much.
When I was eight years old, a new girl came up to our class. It was so <unk> as you see all the new girls.
I had big amounts of hair in a very brilliant hair and a small <unk> of <unk> it was incredibly strong for the <unk> of the <unk> -- very good for <unk>
I ended up that year and I was filled with <unk> until I <unk> my <unk>
And one day I turned up a time after the <unk> of the school, I was a little late late and put me on the heart of girls.
When the coast of the West was <unk> B, I went on the room of the <unk> I took the table of my teacher the book of <unk>
And then I did.
<unk> <unk> <unk> just a little bit, only a little bit.
All the <unk>  And I took me to bring me the book to the <unk> but to see, some of my other people had very good notes as well.
So in a <unk> <unk> the notes around the world, without no imagination.
I put all of them all of the <unk> and I have a row of <unk> and just for being there, you have a <unk>
I still feel what I did.
I don't understand how the idea.
I don't understand why I felt about it.
I felt important.
I don't understand why I never <unk>
It's that everything was <unk> obvious now.
I never <unk>
But about all, I <unk> the reason that I thought that this was so small it was so good for <unk>
I was <unk>
They're so <unk> and so <unk>
We know that babies suffer from <unk>
And also the <unk> birds are very <unk>
We know that the <unk> are the causes number of <unk> in the U.S.
And yet, I've never seen a study that <unk> the <unk> or the long <unk> or <unk>
And so that's why you have to go to the shoulder, because the <unk> are like the lab in which you study the <unk> in all their possible forms.
In fact, I don't know if it's an obvious saying that if I didn't have <unk> <unk> would be no literature.
So there would not be <unk> the <unk> no <unk>
There would be <unk> <unk> and <unk> and a <unk>
It would be <unk>
<unk> the list of school school because it would be losing "The <unk> and the <unk> would not be <unk> or <unk> and <unk> and <unk> <unk>
However, there is no <unk> I know that it's <unk> I know that <unk> has the answers for all, and in the way to the <unk> almost that has all of it.
This year is <unk> 100 years of his work called <unk> <unk> for the time <unk> the most <unk> study of the <unk> <unk> and also the <unk> <unk> I mean, everything that we could have.
We think of a boy trying to get the dream.
We think of a <unk> <unk> in <unk>
We forget about what that image.
We forget about what it is.
I mean, it is about books that <unk> <unk> said they were so hard, like <unk>
I don't know how the <unk> <unk> but we think it's <unk>
Let's look at what they go so well together, the novel and <unk> <unk> and <unk>
It's going to be very obvious as the <unk> that we put into the person, your wish, to their <unk> are a very good narrative of <unk>
I don't know. I think that we get very close to the bone, when we think about what happens when we feel <unk>
When we feel <unk> we have a story.
A story about the life of other people, and those stories make us feel terrible because they're designed to make us feel bad.
At the time we had a <unk> and audience, we know exactly what details we were going to be able to make the <unk> right?
The <unk> they do all of the <unk> <unk> and that's something that I <unk>
All that she makes you to give you the pleasure could be pleasure to another, maybe now it's <unk>
And it starts to say I know the same thing that story, and since then, <unk> says that every single <unk> that <unk> <unk> in its <unk> <unk> in its <unk> <unk> in its <unk> camera.
You have to admit that <unk> and <unk> were incredibly <unk>
You know, <unk> <unk> would have to leave the country, if they wanted to break with it.
But you don't have to be so <unk> to recognize that it's a good job.
<unk> are <unk>
It's a <unk> emotion, there is <unk>
And how are the <unk>
<unk> are <unk> of information.
<unk> use the detail.
The <unk> things like the big amounts of bright hair and <unk> and small <unk> <unk>
The <unk> are <unk> of the photos.
It's why <unk> is so <unk>  <unk> <unk> the language of the <unk> language.
When you <unk> it is in her <unk> <unk> behind the doors and <unk> to the <unk> of their <unk> then the <unk> of the <unk>
He says, "Look, I know you that you think this is <unk> but it's not different to the <unk> of a ancient text or looking at a <unk>
He says, <unk> research with real value <unk>
<unk> is trying to prove that the <unk> you see <unk> and they do it seem to be <unk> but in the <unk> are the search of knowledge, to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to make it <unk> the real truth of the truth.
The pain, the <unk> the <unk> these were the <unk>
He says, "The woman who we need to be able to be able to be able to be able to make us a range of feelings and much more profound than one man that can be <unk>
It's saying that we're going to be going to look for women.
No. I think it's trying to say that the <unk> will give us ourselves.
And there's some other excitement that makes us <unk> in this way.
There are some other excitement of us <unk> our <unk> our logic and our <unk>
Any other excitement that led us to look at the intensity so <unk>
Anybody write about this later.
A day, Bob was looking for a very <unk> young young thing that they had with the idea that his woman was <unk>
And thirdly, it says that there was something strange in that man, which is not <unk> in what I did his wife.
Well, she was <unk> all the world.
The poor creature was under <unk> without any cause.
But he was looking for things that I did his wife, without going to be able to be <unk>
<unk> <unk> or <unk>
Anybody says that the man was becoming the <unk> of his wife.
<unk> are very good in this.
<unk> describe very good how the <unk> are going to look at it with intensity but <unk>
In fact, the more <unk> <unk> we can become <unk> <unk>
And by this reason, I think, the <unk> will take us to make <unk> <unk>
<unk> brings us to <unk> in ways to <unk>
Now I'm thinking about me in me at eight years -- I <unk> but I'm also thinking about this story I heard in the news.
A woman <unk> <unk> years ago, I was able to be created by having a false account in Facebook, since the one that they took messages <unk> <unk> <unk>
For a year.
She was trying to <unk> to the new girlfriend of his <unk> <unk> I have to ask you that when or this, I went to <unk>
Because let's be <unk>
What big even though we said, "Well, right?
It's like <unk>
As a kind of novel <unk>
<unk> is one of my favorite thing.
She's a very strange character and brilliant character of the American literature.
It's the <unk> of <unk> in a <unk> and "The <unk> <unk> who are trying to try to try to try to try to try to make the <unk> <unk> our minds and once we are in the exhibition in the realm of <unk> the <unk>
Let's take it to Tom <unk> his most famous character.
I took <unk> <unk> or want to want you what you have to take out of your being and <unk> and the <unk> of what some time <unk> and it's under the floor.
It's a way.
But what do we do? We can't take the <unk>
I can't give you all the world around the world, so as sometimes I did.
It's a <unk> because we live in the time.
We live in the time.
I mean, we are good citizens of social media where the <unk> is <unk> right?
<unk> tells us the <unk> I'm not safe.
So we're going to do what the characters are always doing when they're not aware of a mystery.
Let's go to the <unk> of <unk> Street and <unk> <unk> <unk>
When people think about <unk> thinks in the <unk> <unk> in the <unk> <unk> that <unk> <unk>
But I always have <unk> <unk> <unk> the head of <unk> <unk> that you need to <unk> <unk> you need the <unk> <unk> but <unk>
He sounds so <unk>
<unk> you need their cars, but they <unk> and <unk> with <unk> in the every one of the <unk>
But as they work together, something you start to change, and eventually in the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> once that <unk> <unk> <unk> all with their solution <unk> it goes to <unk> and says, "No <unk>
We are proud of <unk>
And he says that there is no person in <unk> <unk> that I didn't want to get <unk> your hand.
It's one of the few times that we see <unk> <unk> in the story. It seems very excited that the scene is also a <unk> right?
It seems to try the <unk> as a problem of <unk> <unk>
You know, in a minute, you know, in a minute, it's the opposite of <unk>
The next minute is the same side.
<unk> <unk> it allows that idea of being the <unk>
It could still be so much.
What if the <unk> are really a matter of <unk> just a question where we allow us to be in the relationship with <unk>
Well, maybe we don't have to be <unk> from the <unk> of the other.
We can <unk> with it.
But I like the <unk> <unk>
So as we hope that we hope that we have the fiction to <unk>
It just is the <unk> <unk>
<unk> used the <unk> the <unk>
And look at what <unk> the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
We are in excellent company.
Thank you.
We used to solve big problems.
The age of July July July July July July <unk> <unk> was born outside of the <unk> <unk> <unk> and we went on the Center of the <unk>
Mary and they were <unk> but the presence of the red surface, it was the <unk> of a collective process.
The <unk> program was the biggest investment in the history of America.
To get to the moon NASA spent about 180 billion dollars today, or the four of the <unk>
The president gave about a few people -- and they asked the collaboration of 20,000 businesses, universities and the U.S.
<unk> people, including the <unk> <unk>
But before the <unk> program, 24 men went to the moon.
<unk> was about the surface, of which we were born after the death of <unk> the year, is now the more <unk>
So why do you do?
They didn't have a lot of <unk> <unk> kilos and something that the 24 <unk> later, a new sense of <unk> and <unk> of our common home.
Why is the <unk> response is that they were because the president Dr. I wanted to show the <unk> that this nation had better <unk>
But the own words of Kennedy in the University of <unk> we give us a better idea.
John <unk> <unk> Some ask, why <unk>
Why do it make it in our <unk>
And they can also ask, why you choose the more <unk>
35 years ago, why fly on the <unk>
Why do you play on <unk>
We went to the moon.
We went to the moon.
We tried to go to the Moon in this decade, and do other things, not because they're a good thing, but because they're hard to be hard.
Frank <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> was not just a victory of the West on the World
In the time, the most strong emotion was the <unk> of the <unk> of technology.
It was because it was really great to do it.
<unk> in the moon happened in a long context of a long list of <unk>
The first half of the 20th century produced the line of <unk> and the plane, the <unk> and the vaccine and the <unk>
In the half of the century, they <unk> the <unk> and it was <unk> <unk>
The technology seemed like to have a little bit of the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
For the highest part of the history of humanity, we can't go faster than a horse or a boat with <unk> but in the survey of the age of the <unk> 10 miles <unk>
From 1900, no human being on the moon.
Nobody has gone faster than the <unk> of the age of the age of the technology of the technology power is <unk> to the power of technology that is <unk> in the power of technology.
I remember looking at the <unk> <unk>
I was five years old, and my mother told me that I didn't get to the tube <unk> <unk> <unk>
I knew that this would be the last mission -- but I was completely sure that I was going to see the colonies in Mars.
So that of the <unk> it happened to our ability to solve problems with <unk> has become a common place.
We hear all the time.
We've heard about the two days here, at TED.
It seems like if we do it, and they would have been <unk> and they would be <unk> with <unk> things, things like <unk> applications and social networks.
There's nothing bad in most of these things.
They have been <unk> and <unk> our lives.
But we don't get the big problems of humanity.
What happened?
There is a <unk> explanation in Silicon Valley, that <unk> that have created companies less used than the <unk> of the years of the years of the years of the years of the <unk> <unk> and <unk>
Silicon Valley, says that the markets are the <unk> in <unk> the incentives that the <unk> of risk of the <unk>
Silicon Valley, says that the investment of risk that would be <unk> the creation of ideas for the funding of <unk> problems or even false problems.
But I don't think that this explanation is good enough.
<unk> basically what is wrong in <unk> Valley.
Even when the charges of risk were in the <unk> point without the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> that could go back in 10 years.
<unk> have always had problems to invest with the technologies to invest with the technologies as energy, that they need a huge capital and development is over the long term, and that development is the long term.
No, the reasons that we can't solve the big problems are more complicated and <unk>
Sometimes we choose to solve the big problems.
We could go to Mars if you <unk>
NASA has even designed a plan.
But we go to Mars would take a political decision that was popular and that never happen.
We don't go to Mars because everybody thinks there are more important things that do on Earth.
Sometimes we can't solve the big problems because the political systems.
Today, less than two percent of the global energy consumption comes out of the energy energy from the <unk> and the solar and the <unk> of the two percent, and the reason it's completely development.
The coal and natural gas are stronger than the solar energy, and oil is more efficient than the <unk>
We want a sources of natural energy that they can compete in the price.
Now, the <unk> the entrepreneurs and economists are aware about what policy and international government <unk> the development of a <unk> energy increase a significant increase in research, and some kinds of control of coal.
But there is no hope in the political climate of that we will see a political political policy of the U.S. and international political policy.
Sometimes the big problems that they seemed like to be <unk>
We know from time time that they are the result of the failure in the <unk>
But 30 years of research, we have taught us that they are going to have taught us that they are active crisis that affect <unk> the distribution of food.
The technology can improve things like the <unk> or the systems for the <unk> and the <unk> systems -- but there will be <unk> as a bad time.
And finally, the big problems -- sometimes <unk> a solution because we don't understand the problem.
The president gave me the war to the war, but as soon we found that there are many types of cancer, some incredibly resistant to the treatment, and only in the last 10 years they seem to have found some effective treatments and <unk>
The hard problems are difficult problems.
It's not true that we can't solve the problems with technology.
We can try and <unk> but these four elements have to be <unk> the political leaders and the population must want to solve the problem the institutions must support the <unk> it must be really a <unk> problem.
The <unk> mission that has become something like a metaphor for the ability to solve big problems, it turns out with those <unk>
But it's a <unk> model in the future.
We're not in <unk>
There is no <unk> competition like in the World War -- there is not a politician like John Kennedy that <unk> how hard and so dangerous, and there is no popular of science science like the exploring the solar system.
In general, you go to the Moon it turned to the Moon it turned to be simple.
I was just three days.
And really, I didn't even be <unk> no problem.
We are <unk> in our present and the solutions of the future will be more hard to do it.
God knows that we don't have the challenges.
Thank you very much.
Well, I'm going to talk about the details, and I'm going to start <unk> the ideas that they have about trust.
They're so common that have become <unk> of our society.
I think they're three.
The first is a <unk> has been a big <unk> of the <unk> is a very complete question.
The second is a <unk>
And the third is a <unk> we should make the trust.
I think the <unk> the goal and the task have bad <unk>
What I'm going to try to tell you to tell you today is a different story about a <unk> a goal and a goal, that I think that day a lot more clear about the issue.
First of the <unk> why people thinks it's <unk>
And if I think about the base of my own <unk> I don't know the answer.
I'm going to think that you can have gone in a few activities or institutions and that could have gone into others.
I don't have course.
But I can be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to think of the view, and the <unk> of opinion are true the source of the belief that trust it has <unk>
When you look at the <unk> of opinion at the long time, there's no evidence of it.
I mean, the people who are <unk> about 20 years ago, mostly journalists and politicians, they're still <unk> the same <unk>
And the people who were very expensive about 20 years -- they are still a pretty <unk> <unk>
The rest are in the middle, and by the way, the average citizen of the street is almost about half the way.
But it's this important evidence as well.
What the <unk> <unk> are, of course, right?
What else you can <unk>
What you look at is the <unk> <unk> that people are, when they do certain questions.
<unk> in the <unk> <unk> in the <unk>
Now, if somebody told you <unk> in the <unk>
<unk> in the <unk>
<unk> in the <unk>
It would probably be able to ask them to ask it, they do that?
And that would be a very <unk> answer.
And you could say, when you've got to look at your question, "Well, I think about some of all, but in other <unk>
And what is very <unk>
In addition to life in real life, we tend to put the confidence of <unk>
We don't think that the level of trust that we're going to feel for a certain type of <unk> or kind of person, it's going to be <unk> in all of the cases.
I could be able to say that I think about a certain professor that I know to give the class of <unk> but in no way to drive the <unk>
After all, I could know that it was not a good <unk>
I could trust my most <unk> friend to keep a conversation, but no, maybe you can get a secret.
<unk>
And if we've got those evidence in our traditional lives of the way that trust is <unk> why we let the side all of the knowledge when we think about confidence in the way more <unk>
I think of the <unk> are very bad tools to measure the real level of real trust because they try to get <unk> the good <unk> to the fact about something or something.
First of all, what happens to <unk>
The goal is to have more trust.
<unk> I think it's an goal.
It's not that the goal that I <unk>
I'm going to get more confidence in what it's <unk> of <unk> but not what it doesn't be?
In <unk> I am <unk> of not aware of what it's not <unk>
And I think that those people who <unk> their own <unk> with the very <unk> -- called Mr. <unk> that then I went on with them, I think about them, and I think, well, yeah, they were too <unk>
And more confidence is not a intelligent goal in this life.
<unk> <unk> or <unk> <unk> that is the right goal.
So one time you say, yeah, you know that it means that what matters in the first place is not the <unk> but <unk>
That's what it comes is to make a judgment about how bad people are in certain ways.
And I think that to be able to make a <unk> we're forced to focus on three things:
They're <unk> They're <unk> They're <unk>
And if we found a person to be <unk> in the <unk> <unk> and it is responsible and then we have a very good reason to trust it, because it's going to be <unk>
But if, on the contrary, they're not <unk> we couldn't trust them.
I have friends who are <unk> and honest, but not <unk> in them to take a letter to the <unk> because they're <unk>
I have friends who are very sure that they can do certain things, but I see that <unk> their own <unk>
And I'm glad to tell me that I think I don't have a lot of friends who are <unk> and so extremely <unk>
If it's so that, I still have been <unk>
But that's what we are <unk> we were going to be <unk> before we do.
<unk> is the answer.
The <unk> is what we have to be.
And of course, it's hard.
In the last decades, we have been trying to build systems of <unk> systems for all kinds of political institutions, and those things that would make us more easy to the task of the <unk>
Many of those systems have had the opposite.
They don't work like <unk>
I remember once I was talking about a <unk> and he said, "Well, you ask you the problem is that it takes more time to make the <unk> <unk> who will go on <unk>
And we found the same problem in all of our public life, and <unk> that the <unk> system is going to ensure the <unk> and the <unk> trials actually is doing the opposite.
What they do is <unk> the work of people who have to make hard tasks like <unk> <unk> that <unk> the <unk> as we do.
You know, all of you know examples about.
<unk> all of that, for the goal.
I think that the goal should be more <unk> and that things would be different if we were going to be <unk> and <unk> to the people who are wrong, and if you think about determine if other people, local or politicians are <unk> of confidence.
It's not easy. It's the <unk> the actions of <unk> which is not going to happen.
First of all, the task.
It will be able to rebuild the <unk> <unk> the things as well.
It suggests that you and I should rebuild it.
Well, we can do it with ourselves.
We can rebuild a little bit <unk>
We can do it if they're two people, together, they are trying to improve the trust.
But the <unk> of <unk> is <unk> because we give them other people.
You can't rebuild what other people have been.
You've got to give you the best enough to be able to trust you.
You've got to be <unk>
And that, of course, it's because you can't be <unk> by all people, all the time.
But you also have to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be <unk>
How do you do that?
That makes you think about all of them all of them -- what makes people common <unk> the <unk> institutions, the very <unk>
I'll give you a simple example.
And the store where I get to ask my <unk> says that I can <unk> without going to be <unk>
I have gotten me to get me the money, or the changes of the color that I want.
That is <unk> I know in them because they get vulnerable to me.
I think there's a big lesson in it.
If you get vulnerable to the other hand, that is a very good test of trust confidence and you have trust what you're saying.
So at the end, I think what we are going to go is not very hard to <unk>
In what people trust is in the relationships, and in that <unk> you can determine when and how the other person is <unk>
Thank you.
Since the beginning of the computers we have been <unk> by reduce the <unk> between us and the digital information between our world and the world of the screen where the imagination can be <unk>
This <unk> has been <unk> and more and more than the point that today is less than one <unk> the one of the glass of a screen screen and the power of computer has become food to all.
But I ask, and if I had no <unk>
I started trying to imagine how <unk>
First created this tool that is in the digital space in the way that when the <unk> <unk> against the screen the physical body to <unk>
The designers can <unk> their ideas directly and surgeons can use with virtual organs under the screen.
So with this tool, you ask the <unk>
But the two hands are still on the screen.
How do you get to the inside and interact with the digital information using all the <unk>
In the <unk> of Science <unk> along with my <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> the computer, and it turned a small space on the organization in a digital area of work.
<unk> a Norden bombsight with cameras to detect the fingers and your face, now you can take the hands of the <unk> and you can see the hands of the <unk> to the inside of the <unk>
As the windows and they have a location in the real, space and <unk> it's so easy as a book of a <unk>
It can look at the book and <unk> lines or words with the virtual sensor that there are the <unk> of each screen.
The architects can be able to be able to be able to fight their models directly with hands.
In these examples, we were <unk> in the digital world.
And if we invest the papers and we make the digital information comes to us?
<unk> many of us will be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be <unk>
Now that doesn't have to worry about.
What I have here is a virtual <unk>
This is the vision that you get from a <unk> device in the head or <unk> when the system is going to understand the geometry of your body.
If we take this idea more far so I thought, instead of only looking at the space in space how we can make them be physical so that we can <unk> and <unk>
How would it be a future.
In the Media Media Lab in the age of MIT with my <unk> <unk> and my <unk> <unk> and my <unk> <unk>
This magnet <unk> it turns up as a 3D <unk> in space which means that as the computer as the users can move the object to any place within this small space.
<unk> what we did was we <unk> the gravity and control the movement.
And the object, we put the object, we put it from the city of the time and the space what you want to say that the human movements can <unk> and go back to <unk> and they have to get them into the physical world.
You can teach them <unk> and the distance and the famous takes of Michael <unk> can be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to
The students can use it as a tool to understand some complicated concepts like the movement of planets, the physical movement, and a difference of the <unk> or the books, or the books of <unk> this is a real experience.
But what is more fascinating to change the physical part of the computer is imagine how to program the world is going to change our physical environment.
As you see, the digital information doesn't just show us something that we start to act on us as part of us as part of the physical world that affects us without that we have to get out of our world.
So we started the talk about today about a <unk> but if you take that <unk> the only limit that is our imagination.
Thank you.
I was <unk> to become <unk> for two years in <unk> China, in the <unk>
When I was in the first grade, the government wanted to get up to a school for <unk> with all the <unk>
But my <unk> mother said, "No."
My parents wanted me to be in engineering, like them.
And then we survive the Industrial Revolution that they think that there was just a way to be able to get it into the <unk> a safe work and well <unk>
No matter if I would like or not.
But my dream was being a <unk> <unk>
This was me, in my piano piano <unk>
A <unk> <unk> must start <unk> from very young to learn the <unk> so I tried everything that I was able to go to the school school.
I wrote to the director of school and the <unk> of a radio.
But no adult <unk> the idea.
No adult took me seriously.
I only my friends was <unk> but they were kids, without authority, as I was.
So at the age of 15 years ago, I knew that it was too greater to train.
My dream never <unk>
<unk> that for the rest of my life is a second of second class was the only thing that it could be.
And this was so well.
So I know looking for another <unk>
No one of my country wanted to <unk> OK.
I would take the books.
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> I came to America in 1995, and what was the first books that we here?
They were <unk> in China, of course.
<unk> <unk> is about the <unk> life.
And it is not <unk> <unk>
The Bible is interesting.
That's a subject for another day.
But the fifth <unk> for me was a <unk> <unk> to your father and your <unk>
<unk> I said, "It's so different, and much better than <unk>
So it became my tool to get out of this <unk> <unk> and to choose the relationship with my parents.
I find it with a new culture also gave my <unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk>
For instance, at the beginning this map was going to be outside because this is what the students in China.
I had been told that China was not to be in the center of the world.
A map means the perspective of people.
<unk> <unk> is not something new.
It's a common practice in the physical world.
There are a lot of research fields like religion and literature and literature.
<unk> and <unk> gives us the <unk> a more profound understanding of a issue.
And I thought if I read it <unk> it was working in the <unk> why do not do it in the <unk> life.
So I started to read books of two.
You can be <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> that they were involved in a same <unk> or friends with <unk> experience.
For the <unk> <unk> are effective policies and <unk>
To the <unk> are all <unk> and the fear of the <unk> <unk>
If you know other language, it's also fun to read their favorite books, in two languages.
They <unk> <unk> Thomas <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> instead of <unk> in the <unk> I found that you can win a lot of it.
For example, it's through the one of the one that I realized that <unk> in Chinese it literally means <unk> <unk> <unk>
And <unk> in Chinese, literally means <unk> <unk> <unk>
I opened me a magic door to talk with people from the past and the present.
I know you not going to feel to feel or <unk>
Because a <unk> dream is not nothing compared to what many other people have <unk>
I've come to believe that the point is not the only purpose of a dream.
The most important purpose is we connect with the place that the dreams, where the voice comes to happiness.
Until a <unk> dream can do that for you.
And it's because of the books, which I'm here, happy, living back with purpose and the most of the time.
So the books always <unk>
Thank you.
Thank you   Thank you.
When I was in my <unk> I saw my first client of <unk>
I was a public student in the clinic of <unk>
She was a woman of 26 years called <unk>
Alex went to the first person using <unk> and a <unk> I took it on the <unk> of my office -- and he said I wanted to talk about their problems with men.
When I heard this, I felt so <unk>
My class had a <unk> as the first <unk>
And I took me a <unk> I wanted to talk about men.
I thought I could do it.
But I didn't do it.
With the TED stories that Alex came up to the <unk> it made me easy to just move the head as they <unk> the solution.
<unk> are the new <unk> he was like, <unk> and why I was doing it was right.
You start working together, and he got children later, it has children later, until the death goes later.
To be aware of the <unk> and I had time from the <unk>
But I was a little bit later, my <unk> <unk> to go to Alex who talk about their life.
I <unk>
I said, "Yes, it's going to be coming up with types of its <unk> <unk> with a head <unk> but it's not as if it was going to get them with <unk>
And then my <unk> said, "It's not not, but maybe it was <unk> with the time.
In addition, the best time to work in the marriage of Alex is before they get <unk>
This is what psychologists call a <unk> time.
It was when I realized that the <unk> are not the new <unk>
Yeah, people feel head after what they <unk> but this didn't make the <unk> <unk> it was a <unk> in its development.
And this made the <unk> <unk> the perfect moment and we were <unk>
So I realized that this kind of <unk> <unk> was a real problem and I had real consequences not only for Alex and their life, but for the team, families and the future of the <unk>
There are 50 million <unk> in the United States, today.
This means about 15 percent of the population, or 100 percent if you think nobody comes to the <unk> without the <unk> before the <unk>
Raise your hand if they're in their <unk>
I want to see the <unk> of here.
Okay. Yeah. They're amazing.
If they work with <unk> they love a <unk> you took the dream a <unk> I want to see. It's okay.
This is not just my opinion. This is the facts.
We know that 80 percent of the key moments in life will go to 35 years.
This means that eight percent of each 10 decisions and experiences and moments and moments that they give their life to be the time to be the time when you have 30 and <unk>
<unk> people are not going to be <unk>
This audience is going to be fine, I think.
We know that the first 10 years of a career have an exponential impact about the amount of money that <unk>
We know that more than half the Americans are found or they're coming up with their partner to 30 years.
We know that the brain ends up its second and last stage of growth in their <unk> and <unk> for the <unk> which means that if there's something that you want to change themselves, now it's the time to change it.
We know that the personality changes more times for their <unk> that in any other time of life and we know that the female debate comes to their top of the <unk> and things get complicated to <unk>
The <unk> are the moment to <unk> about their body and their options.
When we think about the development of the child, we all know that the first five years of the language and the attachment in the brain.
It's a moment where your life and common life has a <unk> impact in the person that they <unk>
But what we don't hear how often is that there is something called the adult development and our <unk> are a critical moment in global development.
But this is not what the <unk> are listening.
<unk> talk about changes in the line of the time.
The researchers call the <unk> a <unk>
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk>
It's true.
As culture, we've been considered a <unk> which is actually the decade that <unk> <unk>
It was <unk> saying that to get great things, you need a plan and not enough time.
It's not right?
What do you think about when you give it a <unk> in the head and they say, you have another 10 years to start your <unk>
Not nothing.
They stopped that person the sense of work, and the ambition and it is not absolutely nothing.
And then all of the days, very interesting things like you or their children and your children and they say something like this: "I know that my <unk> is not good for me, but this relationship doesn't do just be killing them.
Or they say, they usually say that as I start to start a career before the 30, all will be <unk>
But then you start to sound something like this: "My <unk> are <unk> and I still have nothing to show you.
I had better <unk> the day I graduated on the <unk>
And then you start to sound something like this: "My <unk> in the <unk> were like the game of <unk>
They all came up and <unk> but then in some time around the 30, it took the music and all started to go back to it.
I didn't want to be the only thing that it was going to happen, so sometimes I think I married my husband because he was the <unk> chair when I had <unk>
Where are the <unk> here?
They don't do it.
Well, that sounds a little <unk> but they didn't get the risks are very high.
When you get a lot of things for the <unk> there is a huge pressure to the <unk> and so many of you start a career, to choose a city, and they have two or three children in a period of time much more simple.
A lot of these things are not <unk> and there are research who start to show you that it's much more hard and <unk> doing all of a time to <unk>
The crisis of the age of the age of the age of the age of the age is not about buy the <unk> cars.
This is what you realize you can't have the career you want to right now.
<unk> you can't have the son you want to have the son that you want to give you a brother to your son.
A lot of <unk> and <unk> you look at themselves, and to me, sitting in the room, and talk about their <unk> "What was I doing?
I want to change what people are doing and thinking.
Here's a story of how it might be.
It's a story about a woman called <unk>
On the winter <unk> came to my office because I was in their own words, having a crisis crisis.
He said, I would like to work on the art or in the <unk> but I still didn't have no <unk> so I spent the last years working as <unk>
As I was more cheap, I lived with a computer, which makes more <unk> that I could.
And despite having a few <unk> very hard, their life had been even more difficult.
<unk> often in our <unk> but then they took it the same thing to say, "You don't choose their family, but you can choose their <unk>
Well, a day he turned up his head on their legs and <unk> for almost all the hour.
I had been able to buy a new <unk> for <unk> and there was all the morning <unk> with their many <unk> but then it turned up to see the empty space that still was still after the words of the words -- <unk> <unk>
I was about the <unk> when I saw it, and he said, "What is going to be for me if I have a <unk> accident.
Who is going to ask me if I gives me <unk>
In that time, I took a lot of work to resist and I don't say, <unk>
And what I needed it was not a <unk> that I really <unk>
I needed a better life, and I knew this was its opportunity.
I had learned a lot of since I worked with Alex as I worked as a <unk> <unk> <unk>
So for the next weeks of weeks and months, I told me about three things that all <unk> man or woman, it deserves to know.
First of all, I told him to <unk> that <unk> of the identity crisis, and <unk> capital of view.
<unk> capital -- I mean, to make something that we think about value to your person.
It's a investment where you want to be later.
I didn't know the future of the <unk> <unk> and no one knows the future of the work, but I know this: capital of identity generates capital of view.
So now it's the time for that work of the country, from that <unk> of that company that they want to help you.
I'm not <unk> the <unk> <unk> I'm <unk> the exploration that I don't need to tell you that, by the way, it's not <unk>
It's <unk>
I told them to give them the jobs that they would make jobs and they do it.
Second, I told you, that the international tribes are <unk>
The best friends are great to give you to the airport, but the ones that they get together with friends with a similar minds in the way who ask them, what do you know how you think about how you think about how you think about how you think about how you think about how you think about how you think about how you think about how you think about
That new piece of <unk> that new person who will go out almost the outside of the <unk>
The new things come from what they call <unk> <unk> friends of his friends.
Yes, half of them have a bad work or they don't have work.
But the other half no, and the <unk> <unk> are the way of <unk> to this group.
The half of the jobs created to be <unk> then, I know the head of your neighbor is the way to get a work with no work.
It's not doing <unk> It's the science of how information is happening.
For the last but not less importantly, I believed that you don't choose their family, but I know their friends.
This was true when I was <unk> but as a <unk> <unk> soon as a partner and it has a partner and it has a partner and <unk> their own <unk>
I told him the time that the time to choose their family had come.
Maybe you think about 30 is the best age to sit around the head that 20 or even 25 or even 25
But you choose to the person that you live now or <unk> now when all of Facebook, you start walking into the <unk> not progress.
The best time to work in your marriage is before you get it, and that means to be so <unk> in love as you're in the work.
<unk> your family must be a conscious choice of who and what is what you want to instead of just doing or kill time who is that the <unk> to you.
So, what happened with <unk>
Well, we take that <unk> and she found the <unk> of a cousin who worked in a <unk> museum in the other state.
And this surgery helped me get a job there.
That credit of work gave a reason to leave the <unk> with the ones that I think.
Now, five years later, it is <unk> special special events in Britain.
And this <unk> with a man that I chose <unk>
<unk> your new career, I love his new family, and I send me a letter that he said, "Now the space of <unk> <unk> <unk>
The story of <unk> can sound easy, but that's what I love to work with <unk>
It's very easy to help them.
<unk> are like planes that they come from the <unk> of Los Angeles, which goes to some of the <unk>
Right before the <unk> a <unk> <unk> in its trajectory makes the difference between <unk> or <unk>
In the same way, at the age of the age or the 25 and even the <unk> a good conversation, a good TED TED talk can have enormous effects in the years or even in the generations of time.
So here's my idea that we were going to spread all of the <unk>
It's as simple as I learned to tell you <unk>
It's what now I have the privilege to tell you as <unk> all the <unk> the <unk> are not the new <unk> <unk> their <unk> <unk> capital of identity using their <unk> <unk>
They don't let me define what they didn't know or what they didn't do.
They're making their life today.
Thank you.
When I was 27 years old, I left a very <unk> work in <unk> a work that was even more <unk> the <unk>
I went to teach them mathematics to the age of age in the New York.
And as any <unk> and it was <unk> and <unk>
I gave them a lot of things.
When the work says, <unk> <unk>
What I call me the attention was that the <unk> was not the only difference between my best and my worst students.
Some of the ones that they had a better use they didn't have <unk> <unk>
A few of my most smart children was not going to be so well.
And that put me to think.
The kind of things that you need to learn in mathematics in <unk> grade, they're <unk> <unk> <unk> the area of a <unk>
But these concepts are not impossible and I was very convinced that every one of my students could learn the lesson if they worked hard and for the time.
After several years of <unk> I came to the conclusion that what we need in education is a better understanding of the students and learning from a <unk> perspective from a <unk> perspective.
In education, the only thing we know how to measure the best way.
It's the <unk> but what happens if we have success in school and in life depends on a lot more than the ability to learn in a quick way and <unk>
So I left the classroom and I went to college to become <unk>
I started studying children and adults in all kinds of scenarios -- and in every study my question was, who has success here and why?
My research team and I went to the <unk> <unk> <unk>
We tried to predict what <unk> <unk> in the military training and who are <unk>
We went to the <unk> National <unk> and we try to predict what kids are going to get the more possible in the <unk>
We study teachers <unk> working in <unk> really hard -- what teachers are still teaching for the end of the year and <unk> who will be the more effective in improving the results of their <unk>
We put them with <unk> <unk> <unk> what about these genes are going to keep their <unk>
And who will make more money?
In all of these very different, so it turned up a kind of important important of success.
And it wasn't the social intelligence.
It wasn't good like the physical health and not the <unk>
It was <unk>
<unk> is passion and <unk> to reach very long term.
<unk> is having <unk>
<unk> is <unk> to the future, day after day, not only for the week, not only for the month, but for years and working really hard to do that future a reality.
<unk> is to live life as if it was a <unk> not a whole career to the whole time.
A few years ago, I started studying the <unk> in the U.S. schools.
I asked thousands of school students who did my <unk> <unk> and then waited around over a year to see who <unk>
It turns out that the children with more likely to have more more likely to <unk> even when the <unk> in every point that I could think about things like the <unk> <unk> the results that they felt when they were in school.
So it's not just in the West <unk> or in the National <unk> of <unk> which matters the <unk> is also in school, especially for the children in risk of <unk>
For me, the most exciting thing about the <unk> is what we know what it knows the science about its development.
Every day, parents and teachers ask me, "How do it development in the galaxy.
What do I have to do to teach children a <unk> <unk>
How do I go back to the long <unk>
The most honest answer is, I don't know it.  What I know is that the talent is not going to happen.
Our data shows very clearly that there are a lot of individuals who are just not still going on with their <unk>
In fact, in our data, the <unk> is not <unk> or it's even connected to the <unk> <unk>
So far, the best idea I've heard about develop the <unk> in the children is something called <unk> <unk>
This is an idea developed in the University of Stanford <unk> and it's the belief that the ability to learn is not <unk> that you can change the effort.
Dr. <unk> has shown that when the kids read and they learn about the brain and how it changes and focus on response to the challenge, they're much more likely to <unk> when they <unk> because they don't believe that that <unk> is a permanent condition.
So the growth of growth is a great idea to develop <unk>
But we need more.
And that's where I end my speech, because that's where we are.
That's the work that we have to go.
We need to take our best ideas, our more expensive, and we need <unk>
We need to measure if they have been successful and we have to be willing to be willing to be willing to start <unk> to start all of the <unk>
In other words, we need to be certain about making our kids are more <unk>
Thank you.
<unk> in Pakistan like the daughter of a <unk> one of my most <unk> or my <unk> mother is my <unk> and the way of the characters of the characters of the characters of the characters and <unk>
Since that time, I <unk> for this incredible language.
But it seems to be so <unk> as the Great <unk> China.
In the last years, I have been asking me if I can make this <unk> so that you want to understand and appreciate the beauty of this way, language can do it.
I started thinking about how a new method and fast to learn Chinese could be useful.
Since that I was five years old, I started learning how to draw each one of the <unk> of every <unk> in the <unk>
I learned new characters every day for the next 15 years.
So we just have five minutes, it's better than we do a stronger form and simple.
A Chinese <unk> <unk> 20 dollars.
You just need a thousand to understand the basic issue.
The first 200 people will allow you to understand about 40 percent of the basic literature enough enough to read signals from <unk> <unk> to understand the basic idea of the website or <unk>
We start with eight to show you how this works.
They're <unk>
You get your mouth as well as you can be <unk>
You get a mouth.
This is a person that is going to give a walk.
<unk>
If the form of fire is a person with arms in both hand, as if it was <unk> in a way <unk> <unk> I'm <unk> this symbol actually is <unk> from the way of <unk> but I like to believe that it's the other way.
This is a tree.
tree.
This is a mountain.
The sun.
The moon.
The symbol of the door looks like a couple of <unk> <unk> in the old <unk>
I call these eight <unk>
They are building building a lot more <unk>
One person.
If somebody walk back, that's <unk>
As the old says the ancient said, two are a <unk>
If one person to make their arms, this person is saying <unk> <unk>
The person within the mouth, the person is <unk>
It's a <unk> like <unk> within the circle.
A tree is a two two trees together, we have a forest.
Three trees together, we also have the forest.
It took a place under the tree, we have the <unk>
It took a mouth on the tree, which is a <unk>   <unk> <unk> that a tree is quite a <unk>
Remember the <unk>
Two <unk> it makes it very much.
Three of them are a lot of <unk>
It took the fire under the two trees, that's <unk>
For us, the sun is the source of the prosperity.
Two people together, <unk>
Three together, those are <unk>
They put the sun and the moon they put together, that is the <unk>
It also means after a day and a night.
The sun comes on the horizon.
A door. It took a place within the door, it's the <unk> of the door.
It took a mouth within the door to do questions.
<unk> <unk> There's somebody in home?
This person is going to come out of a <unk> <unk> <unk>
The left, we have a woman.
Two women together, they're <unk>
Three women together, they're <unk>
So we've been now about 30 <unk>
When we use this <unk> the first eight <unk> will allow them to build <unk>
The next group of eight characters build other <unk>
So with every small <unk> will be able to learn a couple of hundreds of <unk> which is the same thing to learn a Chinese <unk>
So after I know the <unk> we started to create <unk>
For instance, the mountain and the fire together, we have a <unk> <unk>
We know that Japan is the land of the sun <unk>
This is a sun put with the <unk> because Japan is at this of China.
So a sun along the <unk> we create Japan.
A person behind Japan, what do we do it.
A small person.
The character to the left are two <unk> <unk> one about the other.
In the ancient China, that meant in <unk> because the Chinese <unk> <unk> to their political enemies in the mountains.
Today, the <unk> has become <unk>
A mouth who tells you where you get out is a <unk>
This is a slide to remind you that I have to leave you and go on the stage. Thank you.
And what I want to be <unk> are the movies that I get to see.
I love to share my favorite films with my <unk> when my daughter had four years ago, we saw the <unk>
The film was <unk> their imagination for months.
Your favorite character was <unk> of course.
He gave a good excuse to use a brilliant wife, and we take a <unk>
But when you see that film so many times, you get to understand that it's extraordinary.
We now live and bring our children in a kind of industrial complex complex <unk>
However, <unk> <unk> was an event in itself.
They didn't start that effect.
The really really took about 40 years ago -- I thought about another movie who was <unk> a boy of metal and a boy <unk> <unk> a girl -- like <unk>
Do you know what I'm talking about.  Yeah.
There's a big difference between these two films, there are a couple of big differences between the <unk> and all the movies that we see today.
One is that there are very old violence in <unk> <unk>
The monkeys are pretty excited like <unk>
But I think that if you see the <unk> you do today, the <unk> would say, <unk> you're the <unk> of the <unk> as the <unk> <unk>
<unk> shoes for <unk> to <unk> <unk> by the <unk> <unk>
But that's not what happens.
Another thing is the only one of the <unk> <unk> is that the most <unk> characters and even <unk> are women.
I began to notice this when I did this <unk> <unk> to my daughter, few years later, and the situation was different.
In that time, I also had a child.
About three years.
It wasn't invited to <unk> because it was still very small for that.
But it was the second son, and the <unk> level there was <unk>    So it was <unk> in the room and it turned up as a mother left with her <unk> and I don't think that he was <unk> but I don't think that he was <unk>
I wonder what <unk>
It would be a matter of value, and <unk>
You have a sense that we chose to be a army for the <unk>
<unk> this with <unk> <unk>
How do you make it <unk> your tea.
I have good <unk> with all and being a <unk>
It's the kind of world where I want my kids to grow <unk> and not a world of men who <unk> which is where we are.
So what is so so much force of the <unk> <unk> force in the films for our kids, and so little from the way of <unk>
There are a lot of literature about the impact of the movies of the films of violence in the girls, and they should be <unk> it's very good.
I haven't read so much about how kids react to this <unk>
I know for the experience that <unk> <unk> doesn't give me the right framework that I had been able to navigate by the world of the adults who is <unk>  I think at the moment of the first <unk> I really understood that <unk> <unk>
My quest has <unk>
Why are they go on there.
I don't know what I should do.
The films are going to focus on the <unk> and they get their <unk> and they don't leave them for other relationships or other <unk>
It's almost like to be a child, you have to be an animal animal and if you're a girl, you have to use a <unk> <unk>
There's a lot of exceptions, and <unk> to the <unk> of Disney to any of you.
But they send them a message to the kids, even though they kids, they are not really their own goal.
They make a rare work to teach the girls how to go against the <unk> but it doesn't necessarily show kids how to defend the <unk>
There's no model for them.
We also have some big women who write new stories for our kids, so real, as <unk> and <unk> and <unk> but they're not going to be a little bit of war.
Of course, the most successful subject of all of the time is going to look at some of the <unk> and every one of them on the <unk> of a child or a man, or a man, or a man, or two men who get friends, or a man, or a man and his son, or two men who put a girl.
Until as many of you are thinking, this year, eventually he did it <unk>
I remember all of you. It's available in Pakistan.
Remember what he said the matter when it was <unk>
I can't believe that there was a film of a <unk>
It's very good not let me leave that <unk>
Well, almost one of these films about the test of <unk>
I don't know if you've heard about this.
It has no <unk> roots and <unk> but maybe we start to start a movement.
<unk> <unk> is a <unk> <unk> and in the age of the 1960s, I recorded a conversation that had been a friend about a friend of movies that you see.
And it's very simple. There is just three questions that you need to be <unk> in the film, there are more than a <unk> character that has <unk>
So, there are you to get the <unk>
These women talk to each other at some point of <unk>
Their conversations are about something more than the boy that as well.  Okay?  Thank you.
Two women who exist and talk about things between it.
<unk> I've seen it, and yet so much, I see it in the film we know and we do?
In fact, this week I went to see a very good movie <unk>
Right? <unk> <unk> <unk> an idea of a consensus that is a <unk> movie of <unk>
<unk> not the test of <unk>
And I don't think that <unk> because a lot of the film, I don't know if you've seen a lot of the film happens in a <unk> where men and women are changed for the crisis.
We have a lot of twice of men who have very profound conversations that have very profound conversations in this <unk> and it's the great time for one of the <unk> and it is the great time for the door and say, <unk> <unk>
This is <unk>
So we put it on the numbers.
In 2011, of the 100 films more <unk> how many of them think they have <unk> <unk>
<unk> isn't bad.
It's not the same percentage that the number of women that we've chosen recently for <unk> then it's okay.
But there's a greater number that this is going to <unk> this room.
The New York Times published a study that government had done.
This is what he said,
In the United States, one of the United States, one of the five women says that has been <unk> in their life.
I don't think it is the <unk> of the <unk>
I don't think the films for children have something to see with it.
I don't think the videos of music or <unk> are closely <unk> but when I hear that <unk> one of the things that I think is that there's a huge amount of <unk>
Who are those <unk> What are those <unk>
What don't you get <unk>
They are <unk> the story that he says that the paper of a whole hero is <unk> to the <unk> with violence and then put it <unk> which is a woman who doesn't have friends and not <unk>
We are <unk> that story?
You know, as a father with the privilege of to raise a daughter like those of you who are doing the same, we found the world and this <unk> <unk> and we want to <unk>
We have tools to our <unk> as <unk> <unk> and we hope that <unk> but I have to ask, <unk> <unk> is going to <unk> if, at the same time, the same time, the same time, it is <unk> our children to get their <unk>
I mean, I think the list of <unk> is a way to do something really important, and here I mean, it was all the parents.
I think we have to show our children a new definition of <unk>
The definition of <unk> is changing.
You have read about how the new economy is changing the role of the <unk>
It's all changing.
When I asked my daughter, which was the favorite character of <unk> <unk> you know what you <unk>
<unk>
<unk> <unk> and <unk>
What do you have any common <unk>
Maybe it's not just the <unk>
I think they're <unk>
I think these are the two people in those films that you know more than color, and I love to share their knowledge with other people to get them to get their potential.
They're leaders.
I like that kind of stories for my daughter, and I like that kind of stories of stories for my son.
I want more stories like that.
I want to less stories where I say to my <unk> <unk> and they're not just and more stories where your work is coming to a team, maybe a team moved by women, to help other people to improve and being better people, like the <unk>
Thank you.
A child, I lived in <unk> and one of the things that I liked was to look at the shores of sea in the shores of <unk> because my parents told me that I would give me me.
But you know, it's hard to find these <unk>
They are in sand and it's hard to see.
However, with the time, I <unk> <unk>
I started seeing ways and patterns that helped me <unk>
This became an passion to find things, in a love for the past and <unk>
And eventually when I started studying <unk> I realized that you see with my own eyes wasn't enough.
Because, as soon, in Egypt, my small beach in <unk> had grown up to one of the <unk> miles on the <unk>
They had grown up with the size of cities.
So this is really what I took me to use images with <unk>
To try to make a map of the past, I knew I had to see the other way.
I want to show you an example of how different we see the <unk>
This is a place in the <unk> of Egypt called <unk>
And all of all, the simple place, it seems to be <unk> but when we use the <unk> and what we can use the <unk> and we want them to be able to be able to be able to be <unk>
What you're seeing are the real changes of the landscape of building the landscape of building and the activities of the <unk>
I want to share with you how we have used the <unk> data to find a <unk> city called <unk> <unk> <unk> for thousands of years.
<unk> was the ancient capital of the ancient Egypt for over 400 years in a period of time that was a period of time that was about 4,000 years.
The place is in the <unk> <unk> and it's really important because in the red East, there was this great renaissance of the ancient art and religion.
<unk> have always known that <unk> I was sitting in some place about the <unk> of the two <unk> that <unk> <unk> within the red circles here, but in some place within this huge <unk> <unk>
This area is now about about <unk> by <unk>
<unk> <unk> <unk> right at the side of <unk> and as it changed with the time, it changed the time, and it turned up the entire city.
So how do you find a <unk> city in a <unk> landscape in a <unk>
I'm going to be able to be the equivalent of the equivalent to look for a <unk> in a <unk> with <unk> eyes and using <unk>
So, we use data <unk> of NASA to make a map of the place, with a lot of a very <unk> change.
We were able to see where the <unk> <unk>
But you can see more <unk> and it's even more interesting, this is a slightly quick area that you see within the circle here, that we thought it could be the location of <unk>
So we're going to focus with scientists doing jobs of <unk> you can see here.
When I say, <unk> is like you take it on ice, but instead of food change, and instead of food change.
Five feet underneath a <unk> layer of <unk> we found a layer of <unk> <unk>
This means that in this possible location of <unk> five feet -- we have a layer of a couple hundreds of years that was a <unk> of a several hundred hundred years ago that we think it's <unk>
We also found jobs of <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> what it shows that there was a <unk>
This might look like that it's not a lot, but when we think about the most common rocks in the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> these are the rocks that are <unk>
So we have a <unk> layer that comes out of the <unk> <unk> in this place.
We also have the evidence of a <unk> model, which shows that what I've been there, was a very important city.
We still don't find <unk> here, but <unk> the place in a future for <unk>
And even more importantly, we have the resources to train young people in the use of the <unk> technology, so they can also be able to be able to make big discoveries.
I want to end with my favorite quote from the red East, it probably was written in <unk> about 4,000 years.
I share the knowledge is most of all the <unk>
There's nothing like that in the land.
So according to TED <unk> it was not founded in <unk> <unk> C.
And what the ideas really really started in <unk> <unk> <unk> in a lost city not for a long time and found out from the corner.
I don't put the search for <unk> <unk>
Thank you very much.
Thank you.
I want to invite you to close your eyes.
Imagine standing there, in front of the door of <unk>
I'd like to pay attention to the color of the door to the material of the <unk>
Now you know, a group of <unk> <unk>
They are <unk> in a career <unk> <unk> and they go on the direction of <unk>
I need to see this <unk>
They're <unk>  they're <unk> they are <unk>
And <unk> from the door of his house.
There are <unk> flying around all of all parts that go on the side of the <unk> that they end up in places that end up in places -- <unk> <unk>
<unk> the <unk> or what there is the other side of the door, and look at the quality of the light.
<unk> with your hand.
It comes from his chair, on a <unk>
It's a horse which is you?
You can feel their blue <unk> they can put them on the nose.
You can smell the fortune of <unk> and you choose to be going to go on the mouth.
<unk> for one side and they walk up to their living room.
In the living room, and doing a lot of your imagination, imagine <unk> <unk>
It's a little bit of <unk> <unk> about her <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
Now let's take the kitchen.
The floor has been <unk> with a white way and from the <unk> come to you <unk> the <unk> of <unk> the <unk> and the <unk> of "The <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
Okay. <unk> your eyes.
I want to tell you about a reasonable competition that leads to every U.S. in New York.
It's called the <unk> <unk> of the United States.
I went to cover this event a few years ago as a <unk> <unk> I thought this was like the end of a <unk> <unk>
There were several men and a few men and a few of the few men and a few of them in a few and different habits of vaccines.
They were <unk> hundreds of numbers -- you were going just a time.
<unk> the names of tens of tens of <unk>
<unk> poems in only minutes.
<unk> to see who could <unk> with the order of a <unk> <unk>
And I thought, "This is <unk>
These people have to be <unk> of nature.
And I started talking about some of the <unk>
This is a man called Ed <unk> that I had come from England and that has one of the best memories <unk>
I asked him, <unk> when you realize you were a <unk>
Ed said, "I'm not a <unk>
And I have an average memory story.
All of those who are involved from this competition say that they have normal memory with.
We said, we have been trained to make these <unk> <unk> of memory, using some traditional techniques using a few techniques -- the same techniques that we used <unk> for <unk> the same techniques that we used <unk> for <unk> books <unk>
And my reaction was, <unk> How is you no heard of this <unk>
We were going to be outside of the room of the <unk> and <unk> who is a wonderful English and imagine, although a little bit of <unk> I said, <unk> you're an American word.
You know <unk> <unk>
And I said, "Oh, right?
If I would like to teach you <unk> <unk> how <unk> the order in a <unk> <unk> of <unk> in national television in national TV.
That's going to tell you the world that you can do it.
And I said, "Well, I'm not <unk> <unk> but maybe you can show me.
I mean, you have to start for something else.
And that was the beginning of a very strange journey, for me.
I ended up on the highest part of the year not just training my memory, but also <unk> trying to understand how sometimes it doesn't work and what can be their potential.
I met a lot of people really interesting.
This is a man called <unk>
He is <unk> so it's probably the worst memory in the world.
Your memory was so bad that I didn't even have a problem of <unk> is amazing.
Someone incredibly <unk> but it was a window that you can see until our memory is that we are.
In the other end of the spectrum I met this man.
This is <unk> <unk> in he <unk> for the <unk> paper in the film, <unk> <unk>
We spent a night together in the public library in the upper library Center <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
And the way to get a number of treated about memory memory makes something more than 2,000 years in <unk> in the <unk> and then in the <unk>
And I learned a lot of things really interesting.
One of the most interesting things that I learned is that there was a time that there was a time where this idea of having memory <unk> <unk> and <unk> was not a way that you can think about today.
It was a lot of time, people spend in their memory, to provide their minds.
These techniques have done possible our modern world, but they also have changed.
They have changed <unk> and I would say that we have changed the <unk>
As we never have need to remember, sometimes it seems to be able to do it.
One of the last places in our planet where they are still going to be doing this idea of a <unk> memory and <unk> and <unk> is this competition as important from memory.
It's actually not so <unk> there are a lot like this around the world.
I was <unk> I wanted to know how these people.
About a few years ago, a group of researchers from London invited to a group of memory, to a group of memory, to the lab.
They wanted to be able to be a brains of some way, structural or <unk> different of us?
The answer was, no.
They're more intelligent than the <unk>
They gave them a <unk> <unk> and the answer was actually not.
There was yet a really interesting difference in a really interesting difference between the brains of memory and the issues of the issues of control with the <unk>
When they put them on a <unk> machine <unk> <unk> their brains as <unk> numbers, values and ways of <unk> they found that in the thousands of memory and <unk> parts of the brain, different to others.
In effect, they <unk> or seemed to get it a part of the brain that it involves memory memory and <unk>
Why? There's something that we can learn about this?
The <unk> of the <unk> <unk> is <unk> as a <unk> race where every year shows somebody with a new way to remember more things, stronger and then the rest of them must get a day.
This is my friend Ben Ben <unk> three times of memory.
In his desk, in front of it, there are <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> that he is going to try to <unk> in an hour, using a technique that he invented and that only he was <unk>
He used a similar technique to <unk> the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
In average hour.
And as there is a great amount of ways to remember things in these bacteria, absolutely all the techniques used to a only concept that psychologists call <unk> <unk>
<unk> with a paradox that known as the paradox <unk> <unk> he said, I tell two people who remember the same word.
That's the <unk>
And then you tell you <unk> that there's a <unk> <unk>
And when I go back later, and I ask you <unk> that word that I told you a <unk>
<unk> <unk>
The person who told you that his name is <unk> is a little likely to remember the same word that the person who said his work is <unk>
The same word, different ability to <unk> that is great.
What about here?
Well, the name <unk> actually means nothing for you.
And with all other memories that are going on for their head.
But the word, <unk> we know <unk>
They use <unk> <unk>
They have <unk> in your hands.
<unk> good when they get home to work.
Probably <unk> some <unk>
And when I <unk> that word for the first time, we started putting <unk> <unk> to <unk> <unk> in some time.
One of the most exciting techniques to do this is a few years ago in <unk> <unk>
It's known as the <unk> of the <unk>
The story says like this: I had a poet called <unk> that I took a <unk>
They had accepted as <unk> because earlier, if I wanted to give a very good party, they didn't take a <unk> <unk> <unk>
He put out of him, <unk> his poem of memory, and <unk> and as soon it was, the room was <unk>
<unk> all of all.
But not only the killed all of all, but it goes up with the bodies <unk> <unk>
Nobody could say who was there, nobody could remember where they were there.
They could not be <unk> the <unk>
A tragedy behind the other.
<unk> standing outside, only <unk> in the middle of the <unk> I got the eyes and realized that with the eyes of your mind, I could see where I had been sitting every day.
I took the family of the hand <unk> where they were their loved minds between <unk>
And what we <unk> is that we all know that we all know more or less <unk> and it is that no matter if we're not good to remember the names or numbers of phone or numbers of phone or <unk> and <unk>
If you <unk> the first 10 words of the story that I just tell you about <unk> is very likely to do it very hard to do it.
But I thought that if you ask them to tell you who I was sitting on the horse <unk> it would be able to <unk>
The idea of the memory of memory is to create this building with the eyes of your mind and <unk> of images with the things that you want to remember the more <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> is the image, more <unk>
This is a advice that comes over 2,000 years than the first <unk> of memory, in <unk>
And how does it work?
So let's say you have been invited to the TED stage to give a talk and you want to do that of memory, the same way I had done <unk> if they had invited them to <unk> about 2,000 years.
What you might do is imagine that they're on the door of his house.
And they come to find some kind of picture of something absolutely crazy and <unk> to help you remember that the first thing that you want to mention is that competition completely <unk>
And then you can imagine your home, and you see the <unk> of the <unk> of the <unk> <unk>
And that I thought you want to present your friend Ed <unk>
And then you see <unk> <unk> to remind that anecdote that you want to go.
And then you go on the kitchen, and the fourth thing that would say would be that strange journey that they did for a single year and have some friends to help them me.
This is like the speakers <unk> <unk> their <unk> not word -- which is going to be <unk> but typical of a typical time.
In fact the term <unk> comes from the <unk> <unk> which means <unk>
It's a <unk> of when people thought in the <unk> and in <unk> with this kind of terms of terms of terms of terms of terms of terms of terms of terms of terms of terms of terms of terms of terms of terms of terms of terms of terms of terms of terms of terms of terms of terms of terms of terms of terms of terms of terms
The phrase <unk> first <unk> it would be like the first place in your memory.
I saw this this was just beautiful, and I put it from full of it.
I went to some of these memory memory and I had the idea of writing something about this <unk> <unk>
But there was a problem.
The problem was that a memory competition is a <unk> event.
<unk> is like to see a lot of people sitting taking <unk> I mean, the most exciting thing that happens is when somebody gets <unk>
I'm a journalist and I need to write about something.
I know that there are amazing things in the minds of these people, but I don't have access.
I realized that if I was going to tell this story, I needed to try to get them in the place.
So I started going to spend 15 or 20 minutes all the morning before I sit on the New York Times, just trying to remember something.
Maybe a poem. Or the names of a ancient <unk> bought in a <unk> market.
And I discovered that this was <unk>
It would never have been expected to be <unk>
It was <unk> because it wasn't just about train memory.
What is actually really to do is improve the ability to create and imagine these images <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and hope <unk> in the eye of the mind.
It was pretty much about this.
This is me, using my standard team for the competition of memory.
It's a couple of <unk> and a bunch of security covered with tape leaving only two <unk> because the logic is the worst enemy of a <unk>
I ended up back to the same competition that had covered a year before. I had the idea that it could be <unk> in a kind of experiment that could be <unk>
I thought this might be a good <unk> for all my research.
The problem was that the experiment came from control.
And I won me the <unk> something that I didn't have to happen.
Of course, it's very beautiful power and the numbers of phone, and <unk> and <unk> but actually it's not the point.
These are so <unk> they work.
Because they are based in very basic principles about how the brain.
And it is not necessary to be going to build <unk> of memory or <unk> <unk> <unk> to benefit with a little bit of how your mind.
We often talk about people with a great memory as if you have a <unk> gift but it's not the case.
<unk> <unk> <unk>
At the more <unk> <unk> when we pay attention.
<unk> when we focus it on the <unk>
<unk> of the <unk> these techniques of memory, are just <unk>
In fact, they're not even <unk>
They work because they make it <unk>
<unk> a kind of particular processing kind of a whole kind of real attention that most of them is not going to get on there.
But the reality is that there is no <unk>
This is how things do <unk>
And if you have something that I want to leave you today, it's what I <unk> the <unk> that I couldn't even remember that I had a problem of memory, I left me, which is the notion that life is the sum of our <unk>
How much we are willing to lose sure that is our short existence of <unk> in the <unk> or <unk> not paying attention to the being human being in front of us, who walk up to our side.
I learned about the first hand that there are a lot of technical memory in all of us.
But if you want to live a <unk> life, you have to be the kind of person who remember <unk>
Thank you.
I'm going to talk about the last 30 years of the story of architecture.
It's a lot to cover in 18 minutes.
It's a complex issue, so you know, just a <unk> <unk> New Jersey.
Because 30 years ago, I am of <unk> and I had six years old, and I was sitting there in home of my parents called <unk> and this was my bedroom <unk>
In the slide of my <unk> I was the <unk> that share with my mom.
And between my morning and the bathroom, there was a <unk> that gave the living room.
And there were all going to look at the <unk> so every time I was from my room to the bathroom, all of me, and every time I was <unk> and I was going to come back to me and he came up in a blog all of me.
And I was like this.
It was <unk> and you know?
<unk> that <unk> I mentioned that <unk> I hated that room and that home.
That's the architecture.
Okay.
Those people, those emotions that I felt, that is the power of architecture. Because architecture is not about mathematics, or from those connections and those connections that we feel in the places that <unk>
And it's not sure that we feel about that way, because of the <unk> <unk> -- the Americans spend 90 percent of their time.
Or 90 percent of the time we're surrounded by architecture.
That's a lot.
The architecture brings us in ways that we don't even do it.
That makes us a little <unk> and very, very <unk>
This means that when I show you a building like this, I know what they <unk> you think about <unk> <unk> and <unk>
And I know what you think about a building building in a building building a half years of the <unk>
This is a <unk>
It's a <unk> that they use the architects to create an emotional connection with the ways we build our buildings.
It's an emotional connection <unk> we've used this trick from a lot of time.
We use 200 years to build <unk>
We use it in the 19th century to build art of art.
And in the United century in the United century in America, we use them to build boys.
Look, these <unk> <unk> <unk> in front of the <unk>
This is very, very useful because building things is <unk>
It's <unk> it takes a lot of time and it's very complicated here.
People who <unk> the <unk> and governments, they always have fear of innovation, and they prefer to use ways that you know they're going to work.
So we found it with buildings like this.
It's a beautiful <unk>
It's the Library of <unk> that I ended up in 2004, in my hometown, and you know, it has a <unk> it has this kind of <unk> and the red, that they leave <unk> what <unk> is to communicate with this <unk> the kids, the values of <unk>
But it doesn't have a lot to see with a library in today.
That same year, in 2004, the other side of the country, he ended up another library that looks like this.
It's in Seattle.
This library shows how we use the media of communication in the age of digital age.
It's a new kind of public equipment for the city, a place to be able to read and sharing.
So how is it possible that in the same year, in the same year, two buildings, both <unk> are so completely different.
And the answer is that architecture works on the beginning of the <unk>
In a side of the side is the <unk> the architects that are constantly making new technologies to make new solutions for the ways of life.
<unk> and we take it up and we've got so much of the people.
And all of the black, this is <unk> you think that we feel very well, but we're infected by inside because we don't have another choice.
We have to go on the other side and go back to us with those symbols <unk>
So we do, and we are all happy, but we feel like <unk> so we start to experience out of <unk> we can start able to make it <unk> we do it on the <unk> and the other time, and the other time.
Well, about 30 years ago of the decade of the 1960s,
The architects were just working with the call <unk>
It has to look at the way.
That can be able to be.
<unk> small <unk>
Something really hard.
So we put them to the <unk> and we started to bring those symbols.
<unk> the <unk> of the other direction.
We take those ways we know that we like and <unk>
<unk> <unk> and we use it and we use a new materials.
I love it.
We don't have <unk>
We take <unk> <unk> and we become <unk> that can be <unk> <unk> made out of the network.
The ways they have been <unk> <unk> and <unk>
<unk> became <unk>
The <unk> grew up to the size of buildings.
Okay.
But they were the <unk> that was great.
We all have the time in the international centers we moved to the <unk> and there, in the <unk> we can create our own <unk> <unk>
Those of those people could be going to be <unk> or <unk>
You can be a <unk> of bread.
This is what happens to the <unk>
This is what happens with the symbols.
They are <unk> because instead of creating a lot of new sites of other places.
I know so well, and all you know, this is not the <unk>
This is <unk>
The architects are going to be excited and we started to make it <unk> the way of new on the other direction.
In the early years, and at the principles of the '90s, we started to experience with the <unk>
<unk> the <unk> symbols now we have with new techniques of design with a computer, and we found them with new <unk> a lot of ways that are <unk> against other forms.
This is <unk> and <unk> and it's <unk> -- you get completely <unk>
Now, the <unk> <unk> <unk> in the opposite direction.
But then, something <unk>
In 1997, this building.
It's the <unk> of Frank <unk>
This building changed the relationship of the world with architecture.
Paul <unk> said that it was one of those beautiful moments when we were <unk> and public and public in general, they were completely completely than a building.
The New York Times <unk> this building <unk>
<unk> in the <unk> turned in a hundred percent when it ended up the building.
So from a sudden, all the world I wanted one of those <unk> Los Angeles, New York, <unk> New York, <unk> <unk>
All the world wanted one, and he was everywhere.
He was our first architect <unk>
But how it is possible that these <unk> <unk> and <unk> how it is possible that they become <unk> in all the world?
And it happened, because the media is <unk> around them and fast so we learned that those ways that we are all of the culture of culture.
We've created a emotional reaction with these forms.
And the same made the major magnitude of the world.
So they all think that if they had these senses, they had culture and <unk>
And this phenomenon of the past of the new architects happened with other societies.
I went to <unk> and <unk> and what happened with these few architects architects in the threshold of the <unk> and actually started to happen with all architecture.
Think about example, how to measure architecture.
A thousand years ago, you would have to have been walking up to the next town to see a building.
<unk> <unk> you can take a boat, a plane, you can be <unk>
The <unk> technology can see in the <unk> and the end, we're all of us from architecture, and the building is more there of their architecture,
The architecture is in all of them now now that means that the speed of the environment finally has reached the speed of architecture.
Because architecture moves so fast,
It doesn't get a long time to think about a building.
You need a lot of time to build a building, three or four years ago, and at that time, an architect can design two, or 100 buildings before you know if that I designed about four years ago or not.
Because they've never been good feedback in architecture.
So it's how we found it with buildings like this.
The <unk> was not a <unk> movement.
For 20 years ago, we were building buildings like this because we didn't have no idea how much the <unk>
That's never going to be going to happen. Because we're on the threshold of the biggest revolution in architecture from the invention of the <unk> or <unk> and the revolution of the media.
My theory is that when it comes to the media.
Now we can make symbols almost <unk> with a very new.
I'll teach you how the system works, the system in a project that my company ended away.
We were <unk> to take this building that <unk>
This is the center of a village called <unk> in the state of New York.
It's a <unk> community.
But that meant that two years before you can end the building, there was a part of the community -- and as the drawings were seemed like it was not the <unk>
The building came to be part of the community that first summer, when people started to get and experience it into the social media, the building left to be just a building of communication, because these are not only images of a building, because these are not just images of a building, are the images that you did the images that you did the images that you did the images
And as you can use it to tell your story, they become part of the personal narrative and that makes it <unk> with the collective memory and the rise of the <unk> ourselves.
I mean, we don't need to tell you how to think of architecture.
We can tell each other what we thought of architecture, because the digital media has not only changed the relationship between us, but they changed the relationship between us and buildings.
Think about a second in those librarians of <unk>
If that building is a lot of today, first <unk> the Internet for <unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk> with examples of innovation, what can be a library.
That's <unk>
<unk> that you can take the mayor of <unk> to the people of <unk> and tell you that there's no response to be a library today.
Let's be part of this.
This challenge of solutions is the freedom of <unk>
It's all different now.
The architects are not those <unk> creatures that they use words <unk> and <unk> and you know, it's not a public audience who don't be seen before.
The architects can listen, and you don't leave it by the architecture.
That means that the <unk> <unk> of a way to another, is irrelevant.
In fact, we can continue to go back and find solutions for the problems that face society.
This is the end of the history of architecture, and it means that the buildings in the morning will be very different to the buildings of today.
This means that a public space in the ancient city of <unk> can be only only and adapt to the as a modern city.
And this means that a stadium in the <unk> can be that, a stadium in Brooklyn, and not a bad smile of the red <unk> in ideas in ideas in ideas that must be a <unk>
This means that you can build our buildings, because we finally will be ready for the ways that you're going to produce.
That means that the buildings are <unk> to the <unk> of nature and not the opposite.
So this means that a <unk> <unk> in <unk> Beach, Florida, where you can be able to do a partner or for <unk> or <unk> or even one can get them up there in the night.
This means that three architects can dream with <unk> in the East East East New York, and raise half a million dollars of the community around that <unk> it's not a client alone.
It means that any building is too small for innovation, as this small <unk> <unk> and <unk> as the animals that are going to see.
Because it doesn't matter if it's a <unk> or a robot who build our buildings.
It doesn't matter how it matters is what we can.
The architects already know how to make more more effective buildings and more <unk>
We've been waiting to all of you all of you.
And then then we are not in sides of <unk>
Find an architect, <unk> and <unk> together to make better buildings, better cities, for a better world, because there are a lot in play.
The buildings don't just reflect our society, but they give them to the more <unk> in the more <unk> in the <unk> and the homes where we make our kids, and the step of the <unk>
Thank you very much.
This is my <unk> <unk>
It was just a year and he started walk.
And what makes that very typical way, typical of the children of a year, <unk> as if your body was moving too fast for their legs down.
It's completely <unk>
And one of the things that I like to do for the moment is you look at the mirror.
And she really love her <unk>
And they get them and <unk> and it gives them the same <unk> big and <unk>
It's beautiful.
To take all their friends do this and my mom realize that I used to do it. And I did thinking, I did I think I was going to do that?
How is that we suddenly are not going to think about our <unk>
Because they don't like it.
Every month, 10 people are going to be <unk> "I'm <unk>
This is <unk> has 13 years and lives in <unk>
And as any of all, you just want to be <unk> and they came on.
It's Sunday by night.
It's preparing for the next week in school.
It has a little bit of fear, it's a little bit about fear, because though his mom tells it all the time that is beautiful, all the days in school, somebody says it is <unk>
Between what his mom says and what their friends, or dreams of the school said, "You don't know who I believe.
So it makes a video of the same, and it comes to other people who please leave a <unk> "I'm beautiful or I'm <unk>
Well, until far, <unk> has received more than 13 <unk>
Some of these are so <unk> that I don't even deserve to think about them.
We talked about a normal healthy eye and <unk> that they get these answers in one of the <unk> of the more vulnerable life.
Hundreds of people are <unk> videos like this, in their most girls trying to communicate this way.
But what's going to do this?
Well, the teenagers of today almost never alone.
They are under pressure of being in the line and available all the time, talking about, <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> this is never there.
Never before we have been so connected to a <unk> way that young young way.
As a mother said, "It's like that there is a party in his fourth <unk>
There is just not there in our own.
And the social pressures that are the hand with this is <unk>
This environment of being always <unk> is <unk> to our children to <unk> based on the number of word, they have and the kinds of examples that they are.
There is no division between a life in the line and real life.
It's really hard to know the differences between what is real, or what it doesn't do.
And also, it's really hard to know the difference between what it's real, and what is <unk>
What is the more <unk> in the life of somebody in front of somebody who are normal in a context in a <unk>
And where they're looking for the <unk>
Well, you can see the kind of images that are <unk> from the news of girls now.
<unk> <unk> <unk> our <unk>
And the technique of the <unk> is now a <unk>
And it's like, <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk>
For those who <unk> <unk> means <unk>
These world are associated from women in the popular culture of today.
It's not hard to see with the young thing.
But the kids are not <unk> to this.
And as the stars of the stars of the <unk> and the singers <unk>
But what is the problem with all of this?
Well, we don't want our kids to grow healthy and be common individuals in it.
But in a <unk> culture of the image, we are teaching our children to spend more time and effort to make it the price of all of the other aspects of their identity.
Things like their relationships, the development of their capabilities of their capabilities and the other things they start on it.
About six of every 10 girls prefer to do something because they think you don't see the good enough.
These are not <unk>
They are different activities for their growth as human beings, and as the society and the field of the development.
Fifty percent, almost one of each three teenagers are not interested in the <unk> <unk> to participate in the <unk> <unk> because they don't want to call your attention for their physical can.
One of the one of the five of each five people are not going to care about the days when they don't feel comfortable about it.
And in the <unk> <unk> if you don't think you look at it, well, specifically if you don't think you're good enough -- you know, you know, you don't think you're good enough -- you know, the average of the age of your dreams who don't care about what to happen.
And this phenomenon has been <unk> in the United States.
And it gives it a lot of what they actually are actually <unk>
So that is good of course, we are talking about how you do you're not about how you are not.
<unk> <unk> on your body is <unk> the <unk>
And it's also <unk> health.
The teenagers with the time. They make less physical activity -- they eat less neurons, they eat less neurons, and pigs are involved in more <unk> and they can take them to a <unk>
They have <unk>
They are more easily <unk> by the people who are around and they're in greater risk of depression.
And we think that it's all about what they take more <unk> as the energy consumption of alcohol and drugs, <unk> surgery <unk> <unk> relationships and drugs, and without protection and <unk>
The pursuit of the perfect body is <unk> the health system, and our government costs thousands of millions of dollars every year.
And we're not <unk>
Women who think they have <unk> again, regardless of if you have or don't have the biggest rates of <unk>
The 17 percent of the women are not putting up to a work in a day where they don't feel vulnerable with the way you see.
Think about a moment where this is doing our economy.
If we could overcome this, what would be that we would be that <unk>
<unk> this potential is in interest for each one of us.
But how do we do that?
Well, let's talk about it, it doesn't make it very far.
It's not bad.
If you really want to change things, you have to do something.
And we've learned that there are three different ways -- the first thing is that we have to trust trust their own body.
We need to help our teenagers to develop strategies to overcome the pressure of the <unk> images and build their self-worth.
The good news is that there are many legal programs to do it.
The bad news is that most of these don't work.
I became very surprised when I learned that a lot of programs a lot of <unk> <unk> <unk> the situation.
So we need to make sure that the program that we're still going to have our children not just have a positive impact but also a regular impact.
And the research studies show that the best programs in six areas -- the first is the influence of family and relationships.
So these six aspects are <unk> <unk> for any willing to give them a education in the body of body that works.
A education is fundamental but about this problem requires each one of us to take the <unk> in the issue and we are a better model to keep the women and girls in our own lives.
We understand the current status of as the women are <unk> and we put them into our circles.
It's not good to tell you with the <unk> of our politicians in <unk> <unk> or the size of their <unk> or the size of the <unk> or the size of the <unk> or the success of the <unk> <unk>
We need to start <unk> to the people that they're not like you see.
All of us can begin to begin to be able to begin to make the responsibility for the kind of images that we published in our social networks.
We can <unk> the people in their effort and their actions and not in their appearance.
And let me ask me when I was the last time that I <unk> a <unk>
In short, we have to work together as a communities, as the governments and the governments and companies and companies in order to change our culture, so that our children can grow up all their person, the <unk> <unk>
We have to put people who are really making the difference in a <unk>
So by making a difference in the real world, we do that they're that they come on the big screen because we just get a different world.
A world where our children are free to become the best version of themselves, where the way they believe that you can see that you can have never the <unk> of being who they are, or that they want to get in their lives.
Think about what this can mean for somebody in their lives.
Who have in <unk>
He <unk>
He <unk>
He <unk>
<unk> <unk>
I could be just the woman that is two <unk> What would it mean for her if I was <unk> in the <unk> that <unk> by not having a long legs -- more <unk> a <unk> <unk> <unk>
What would it mean for her if we were <unk> this and <unk> and we have a lot of the potential that we can.
Now the obsession of our culture with the images is <unk> to all.
But let's take our children the truth.
<unk> that the way you see is just a part of your identity, and the truth is that we love for those who are and why they do, and by how we do it.
<unk> <unk> in the <unk> of our schools.
Let's move every one of us, the way we talked and we compare them with other people.
And <unk> together as a community from small groups to governments, so that the small <unk> of a year of the age of today, it is in agents of a year of the age of today, it is in agents of the entire change.
Let's do it.
The five of 1990, a gentleman called <unk> <unk> I went to a hotel hotel in Manhattan and <unk> <unk> <unk> the leader of the <unk> <unk>
<unk> who was going to be <unk> but it was going to be <unk> by other <unk> <unk> in the company in the company they started to plan out of the <unk> <unk> to about a few of the New York, including <unk> <unk> and <unk>
And so many of those people are <unk> by a <unk>
<unk> the bomb bomb in the World Trade Center didn't be <unk>
More late late <unk> it would be convicted by their participation in that <unk>
<unk> <unk> is my father.
I was born in <unk> <unk> in 1983, being a <unk> engineer with a <unk> mother in the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> the two they did all the possible <unk>
I just had seven years ago, our family started to change.
My father taught me a way of <unk> that very old <unk> even most of the <unk> they get to know it.
So for the experience I saw that when people take time to change it doesn't need a lot for the same things in life.
However, in all of religion, in all of religion, in all of the human group, there are always a small fraction of people who are <unk> so <unk> to their <unk> that thinks you have to use all the media possible so that everyone lived as them.
A few months before the <unk> he felt with me and explained to me that in the last end of week, and some of them had been going to training training to training training in Long <unk>
He told me that I was going to go on the next day.
We got to the <unk> <unk> that without know that our group, was <unk> by the FBI.
When I said, <unk> my father helped me to support the <unk> on the shoulder and explained to me how to point about about 30 feet.
And that day, with the last bullet that said, I gave the small light light on the goal and the surprise of all, especially me, all of all, especially of all, all of all, all of all, all of all, all of all, all of all, all of all, all of all, all of all, all of all, all of all, all of all, all of all, all of all,
My uncle came down to the other and <unk> said <unk> <unk>
As a father, as a child.
And all of all, the comment came up a lot of <unk> but only about a few years later, I understood what they were doing so funny.
Did you look at me, the same level of destruction that my father could <unk>
Those people would be <unk> by putting a way to put it up with 700 kilos of <unk> in the <unk> <unk> of the World Center in the World Trade Center causing a explosion that killed six people and <unk>
I admired those men.
He call it <unk>
When I was <unk> I had moved up 20 times. And so I didn't allowed me to do a lot of <unk>
Every time I started to feel comfortable about somebody -- close to somebody -- and we go back to another city.
As I was always my face of the kind of class that often was <unk> <unk>
<unk> secret my identity to avoid being the <unk> but being the new of the <unk> class, and <unk> was enough <unk>
So the highest part of the time I was going to go on home and playing video or playing games.
For these reasons I didn't have the social skills to say that they were <unk> to grow under <unk> I wasn't prepared for the real world.
And I <unk> <unk> to the people, with the base of <unk> <unk> like their religion.
So how could I open the <unk>
One of the first experiences that they put to test my way to think, was for the <unk> elections of 2000.
In a <unk> program where I was born in the National <unk> in Philadelphia.
My group is <unk> in the subject of violence violence -- as I had been <unk> <unk> almost all my life, was something that I felt a lot of passion.
The members of this group came from a bunch of different <unk>
A day, to the end of the <unk> I discovered that one of the kids who had been done in <unk> was a <unk>
It took several days to go to light this detail and I realized that there was no <unk> between the two.
Never before I had a Jewish friend and funny, I felt very proud to be able to overcome the barrier that the whole life had been done to believe that was <unk>
Another critical moment came when I got a year of summer, <unk> <unk> <unk>
I found them with people from all kinds of beliefs and culture, that experience became fundamental in the development of my character.
All the life was taught me that the <unk> was a sin and <unk> all the people were bad <unk>
I had a chance to work with the opportunity to work with blind actors there, and I could see that several of them were the more <unk> and less than there were seen in life.
A little bit of <unk> I developed a sense of empathy to the suffering of the suffering of the suffering of the time, but it wasn't easy to me to try to people, the other way as I would have to be <unk>
For that feeling I was able to be able to be able to give me a child, with the experience of interaction in real life.
I don't know how to be <unk> but I know what it is being like something beyond my control.
Then the <unk> <unk> <unk>
All of the night he said, Bob was going to be <unk> honest about my <unk> and I was able to see that the race of the people, religion or <unk> <unk> don't have nothing to see with the character.
In a lot of ways he became my shape in a moment in a moment that I was desperately <unk>
<unk> the inspiration can come from the same, and that a African guy had had a better influence in my life that my own father, <unk> wasn't in <unk>
A day I had a conversation with my mother on how I was changing my way to think, and she told me something that you are, in my heart -- because it's alive.
And she looked at the eyes of somebody who have suffered enough with <unk> <unk> and he said, "I'm <unk>
In that time I realized how much energy energy, you need to keep all of that hatred in your audience.
My real name is not <unk> <unk>
I changed when my family decided to break the relationship with my father and start a new life.
So why I decided to go out and put them in a possible possible way.
Well, it's simple.
I've been done because I hope that somebody was going to bring them to the violence, you can hear my story and understand that there is a better way, that even though I was going to get me to this ideology ideology and <unk> I didn't have to ask me <unk>
On the contrary, I decided to use my experience to fight against terrorism and <unk>
I do this for the victims of terrorism and the <unk> of the <unk> and the losses that terrorism has gotten in their lives.
On the victims of terrorism to talk about those computers without sense, as <unk> to the actions of my father.
With this <unk> I come here as a test that violence is not enough to no religion or <unk> who children don't have to keep the <unk>
I'm not my father.
Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you very much.
In this time there is a film that is happening in their minds.
It's an incredible <unk>
It's on 3D and you have sound <unk> of what you hear and you see right now but that's just the beginning.
Your movie has <unk> and <unk>
It is your body, your pain, your tea.
It has emotions, and happiness.
It has memories as a moments of your childhood who come on to your eyes.
And it has to get a <unk> voice in your real thinking.
The heart of the film is you who live all of the whole way.
This film is your flow of consciousness, the subject of the experience of mind and the world.
consciousness is one of the fundamental truths of the existence of the human being.
Every one of us is useful.
We all have a <unk> film -- you know, and you.
There are nothing to be <unk>
For least I know that I have a good consciousness to it.
I don't have sure you're aware of it.
consciousness is also the reason to live.
If we were not going to be aware about our lives would have sense or value.
But at the same time, it's the most extreme phenomenon of the universe.
Why are we <unk>
Why do we have these films <unk>
Why are we not only robots that <unk> what we have to produce the results without experience -- without experience the movie <unk>
In this moment, nobody knows the answers to those questions.
I think that to integrate the consciousness to science, you need some positive ideas.
Some people say it's impossible a science of consciousness.
<unk> of science, is <unk>
<unk> is <unk>
So you can never have a science of consciousness.
Because for almost all the 20th century <unk> that vision.
The psychology studied the behavior -- the neuroscience studied the <unk> brain -- but never no one I mentioned consciousness.
Even 30 years ago, when TED started a very few job in consciousness.
<unk> 20 years ago, all started to change.
<unk> like Francis Crick and physicists like Roger <unk> they said, <unk> is the moment for the science of <unk>
And since then, there was a real <unk> a <unk> of the scientific work.
And this work was fantastic.
But it also has fundamental limitations to the time.
The center of the science of consciousness in the recent years was the pursuit of <unk> <unk> between some areas of the brain and some states of consciousness.
We saw something about this guy in the great work that <unk> <unk> a few minutes.
We now understand a lot of better, for example, the areas of the brain that are related to the conscious experience of seeing values or feel or feel happy.
But this is still a science of <unk>
It's not a whole science way.
We know that these areas of the brain are related to certain kinds of personal experiences but we don't know why.
I would like to explain saying that this kind of work of neuroscience responds some of some questions that we want to explain the consciousness. The questions about what they make certain areas of the brain and what they <unk>
But in a sense, those are the <unk> problems.
<unk> to <unk>
In fact, there's no easy problems with consciousness.
And you don't take the real mystery of this <unk> why all all the physical process in the brain has to be able to be <unk>
Why is a <unk> movie <unk>
In this time, we can't understand.
And you can say, let's say, let's give you a few years to neuroscience.
It is going to turn up in the other phenomenon as the <unk> as the <unk> as the life, and we're going to find explanation.
<unk> <unk> are all cases of biological behaviors how the <unk> how they work <unk> how they do the <unk> how they get <unk> and <unk> the living organisms are questions.
That would be able to apply the human brain to explain some behaviors and the functions of the human brain in the human brain as a <unk> phenomenon -- how we talk about how we set up all of the behavior.
But when it comes from consciousness, the questions about behavior are between the easy problem.
But the hard problem is the question of why all behavior is for a <unk> experience.
And here's the standard paradigm of the <unk> the standard paradigm of psychology actually still doesn't have a lot to say.
I am a specific scientist,
I want a scientific theory of the <unk> that it works.
But at the end, I came to the conclusion that that was not working for reasons.
I think we're going to be <unk> in this point.
We have a very wonderful <unk> chain we can be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to combine the chemical medicine part of vaccines.
But consciousness doesn't seem to fit on this <unk>
On the one side, it's a fact that we're aware about.
On another, we don't know how that idea of our scientific vision in the world.
I think consciousness, now it's a kind of <unk> something that we need to integrate to our view of the world, but we don't know it.
With a <unk> like this, you can need similar ideas, I think we need ideas that we need to have ideas that we can deal with consciousness of a scientific way.
There are some possibilities for those ideas.
My friend Dan <unk> which is here today, it has one.
Your idea is that there's no good problem of consciousness.
So the idea of the film of the film is <unk> it includes a kind of illusion or <unk>
In reality, what you have to do, is to explain the functions to make the behaviors of the brain of the brain.
Well, more power for it.
That's the kind of radical idea that we need to explore if we want to have a theory of consciousness is <unk> based on the brain.
At the same time, for me and a lot of others, that vision is pretty close to just think that the observation of consciousness is <unk>
But I'm going to be a different way.
In the time that I mean, I want to explore two ideas that I think can be <unk>
The first idea of crazy idea is that consciousness is interesting.
<unk> sometimes take some aspects of the universe as a <unk> and the space and mass.
<unk> laws that <unk> as the laws of <unk> or quantum mechanics,
These laws and fundamental design is not useful in terms of anything more useful.
The contrary, they think of all, and there is the world.
Sometimes the list of the fundamental <unk>
In the 19th century discovered that you can't explain the <unk> things in terms of the fundamental concepts in terms of the fundamental concepts of <unk> -- and time, <unk> laws of <unk> and <unk> the basic forces as a fundamental concept that those laws are.
I think that's the situation we found us with consciousness.
If you can't explain consciousness in terms of ideas in terms of fundamental ideas -- and time, <unk> <unk> -- then by the question of <unk> you have to take the list.
The more natural thing would be <unk> consciousness as a fundamental thing that is a fundamental part of nature.
This doesn't mean that suddenly is not object of science, it's not like the way.
But it opens the way to be <unk>
So what we need is to study the fundamental laws that govern consciousness, the laws that affect consciousness with other concepts -- the space -- the time, and the time, the <unk> processes available.
<unk> sometimes say that we want the fundamental laws as simple that we can <unk> in a <unk>
The situation of consciousness is something like this.
We want to find the fundamental laws as simple that we can be able to be able to be able to be <unk> in a <unk>
We still don't know what laws are, but that's what we do it.
The second idea is that consciousness can be essential.
Every system can have a degree of consciousness.
This vision sometimes is called <unk> <unk> for all, and every system is aware not only the humans, the <unk> the mice, the mice, even the microbes of Rob <unk> the particles.
Even a <unk> has some of consciousness.
The idea is not to be smart or <unk>
It's not that a <unk> can be full of <unk> when I thinks I mean, I always took the speed of light.
I can never say, <unk> <unk>
No, that's not.
But the thought is that you may be some of the <unk> you can have any kind of sense of feeling <unk> <unk> some of the <unk> of consciousness.
This can sound a little bit crazy for you.
How somebody thought about something so <unk>
In the part of the first idea of the first idea that consciousness is fundamental thing.
If it's fundamental like space the time and the <unk> is natural <unk> that can also be <unk> like others.
It also is also a notice that though the idea is <unk> it's a lot less for the people of different cultures where the human mind seems more a <unk> with nature.
A more profound reason comes from the idea that perhaps the most simple way to find basic laws that <unk> the thought with the physical process, it's <unk> consciousness with information.
There is always that there are information processing there is consciousness.
<unk> <unk> as in a human being a human being.
<unk> of a simple information, consciousness of a simple.
Something very exciting is that in the years of the recent years -- a <unk> <unk> <unk> it took this kind of theory and I grew up with <unk>
It has a chemical measure of information, which is called <unk> which is the level of information on a system.
And it's supposed to be able to look at consciousness.
So in a human brain, there is a incredible degree of the integration of information, a different degree of <unk> a lot of consciousness.
In a mouse there is a <unk> level of information, just like a pretty important level of consciousness quite important.
But when it comes to the <unk> <unk> particles, the <unk> <unk>
The level of information, but it's not zero either.
In the <unk> theory, there is still a different level of zero.
It made a fundamental law of the <unk> at the <unk> <unk> in consciousness.
In addition, another reason is that the <unk> can help us integrate the consciousness to the physical world.
<unk> and the <unk> they often have noticed that the physics is <unk> <unk>
It responds the structure of the reality using a lot of <unk> but we don't talk about the reality that it comes down.
As he explains Stephen <unk> where the fire comes on the <unk>
From the vision of the <unk> the equations of physics can leave it as they are, but you can use it to describe the flow of consciousness.
That is what we make physical <unk> basically describe the flow of consciousness.
According to this vision, consciousness is what you put fire in the <unk>
In that vision, consciousness is not outside of the physical world, as a kind of <unk>
It's there.
And this vision, I think, the <unk> vision has the potential to <unk> our relationship with nature, and it can have social identity and creative consequences.
Some of you can be <unk>
I used to think that I didn't have to eat anything that had consciousness, then I had to be <unk>
If you're a <unk> and you take that vision, you're going to be a lot about.
I think I thought, well, this tends to transform your <unk> whereas what matters in terms of terms of <unk> and <unk> <unk> it's not so much the fact of consciousness, but its importance and its complexity.
It's also natural to ask by consciousness in other systems like computers.
What is about the artificial intelligence system, in the movie <unk>
It's <unk>
According to the vision of the <unk> information, it has a processing information processing that the answer is yeah, if it's conscious of it.
If this is right -- you know, you know, you get a pretty serious problem on the <unk> of the development of smart systems and <unk>
And then then you can ask you for the consciousness of <unk> the planet.
Canada has their own <unk>
Or a more local level, a group group like the audience in a TED talk about this moment we have an collective consciousness in a TED talk about this time we have an collective consciousness to TED, a whole movie of the films of <unk>
I don't know the answer to that question, but I think at least it's a question that you have to get seriously.
So this <unk> <unk> is a <unk> vision and I don't know if it's right.
I'm actually more sure about the first idea that consciousness is really fundamental than the second of the second of the second of the <unk>
<unk> takes a lot of questions, a lot of things, like, how those bits of thinking contribute to the kind of complex consciousness that we know and do it.
If we can answer those questions, then I think we're going to be going on the right way to a theory of consciousness of consciousness is serious.
If no, well, it probably is the most hard problem of science and <unk>
We can't wait on the night to the morning.
But I think we finally will be going to be going to be going to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be
To rethink consciousness is the real point, I think, to understand the universe and to understand ourselves.
Maybe we just need the crazy idea right right.
Thank you.
I grew up in a small village in <unk>
I had a very normal experiment a under education.
I went to school, I went to me with my friends, I took me with my <unk>
It was all very normal age.
And when I had 15 years old, a member of my community came back to my parents because I wanted to get <unk> for a community of the community.
And my parents said, "Well, that is very good -- but there's a problem.
And she actually has a reality <unk> 
I went to school, I had good notes. After school, I had a under the <unk> of my mother, and I spent a lot of time looking at the <unk> <unk> the <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk>
Yeah, I know. What is <unk>
But they had right.
I didn't do anything that was extraordinary at all.
None of you can be <unk> as a challenge if we took the disability outside the equation.
I've been more later, it was in the second part of the teaching in a high school in a high school of <unk> as only after about 20 minutes in the class 11 studies -- a guy came up and said, "Hey, when you turn your <unk>
I said, "What <unk>
Well, I had been talking about the law of <unk> for some good 20 minutes.
And he said, "You know, you know, your <unk> <unk>
When people in the <unk> people talk about things about <unk>
"Why?" <unk> in the room of <unk>
And it was then when I gave me, this boy had had experiences with people with business objects like <unk> objects.
And we don't know it. And it's not the <unk> of <unk> is that that's true for many of us.
For us, people with disability are not our teachers or our doctors or our <unk>
We are not the real people, we are there to be there.
And in fact, I'm in this stage <unk> what I do in this chair of <unk> and you probably probably be waiting to you <unk> Right?  Yeah.
Well, ladies and gentlemen, I'm afraid <unk> <unk>
I'm not here for <unk>
I'm here to tell you that we have been <unk>
Yes, you have been sold the tell that business is something <unk> <unk> <unk>
It's kind of bad and live with a disability makes you a lot of <unk>
It's not a bad thing, and you don't get a little bit.
And in the last years, we've been able to spread even more this <unk> through social media.
It's possible that you've seen images like this: "The only disability in life is a bad <unk>
Or this <unk> <unk> <unk> is <unk>
Or this <unk> <unk> <unk>
These are just a couple of examples, but there's a great amount of them.
It can be seen one of the girl without hands with a pencil with a pencil <unk>
It may have seen a boy who took with legs of carbon <unk>
And there are a lot of these images, which are what we call inspiration <unk>
And they use the term there -- <unk> <unk> to a group of people for the benefit of another group of people.
So in this case, we get to the <unk> in the <unk> of the people.
The purpose of these images is <unk> <unk> so that we can see them and think about very bad than my life, could be worse.
I could be that <unk>
But if you are that <unk>
So I lost the number of times that have been taught strange <unk> I think that I think I think I am <unk> or a source of humans, and this was going to happen before my work had a <unk>
It was as if I <unk> by the morning and remember my own name.  And this is <unk>
So these images, those images are <unk> to people with common people in the <unk> people.
They're there so you can see and think that things are not as bad for you, or to put their issues in perspective.
And the life as a <unk> is actually something hard.
<unk> some things.
But things that we have is not the things that you can think.
They're not all of the <unk> our bodies.
I use the term <unk> <unk> <unk> because I was going to take me to the call model of the <unk> which tells us that we're more <unk> because of society we live because of our bodies or <unk>
So I've lived in this body for a long time.
I'm very <unk> with it.
And the things that I need to do, and I've learned to take the best of their ability as you do, and that's what happens to the children of those pictures too.
They're not doing anything outside of it.
They're just using their bodies taking the best of their ability.
So, it's really just <unk> in the way we do, to share those <unk>
When people say, "You're a source of <unk> it says as a <unk>
And I know why happens.
It's going to cause the <unk> because they have been sold this talks that the disability makes us a <unk>
And I think it doesn't do it.
And I know what you're thinking about.
I'm here <unk> the individual, and you say, "Why?" God, you're not sometimes it was not sometimes it was going to be <unk>
And I really know what I am.
<unk> of other people with disability in all time.
However, I don't get <unk> I'm more lucky than them.
<unk> which is about a great idea to use a bunch of <unk> <unk> to choose the things that <unk>  <unk> the kind of trick of how to navigate the <unk>
Great.
We learn out of the force and resistance or resistance of the others, not against our bodies and our <unk> but against a world that <unk> and <unk>
I really think that that tells us about the disability is the greatest <unk>
It makes us life.
And that <unk> "The only disability in life is a bad <unk> the reason that is the reason that is the reason that it's not true because of the social model.
A bunch of <unk> to a <unk> <unk> has no fact that it becomes a <unk>
Man:     <unk> to a television screen not going to be going to get the <unk> for people <unk>
There is not a lot of people in the middle of a <unk> and <unk> a positive attitude to turn all those books to the <unk>
It's just not going to happen.
I want to live in a world where the disability is not the same, but <unk>
I want to live where a girl of 15 years ago, sitting in his morning seeing <unk> the <unk> <unk> <unk> not <unk> not <unk>
I want to live in a world where we don't have a whole world where we don't have so <unk> in the people with disability that we are <unk> by the <unk> and remember our names for the morning.
I want to live in a world where the <unk> can be able to be able to be able to live in a world where a boy from 11 school in a <unk> school is not not a little chance that your new teacher is a <unk> <unk>
<unk> doesn't make us <unk> but question what you believe to know about what you do it.
Thank you.
What do you have to see the reality <unk> and the <unk> <unk> with the <unk>
And what is the average speed of a <unk> without <unk>
Unfortunately, we just respond to one of those questions, so please don't be <unk>
When people think about <unk> I think about <unk> <unk> and in Tom <unk> <unk> the hands in the air, but the reality is not a science box.
<unk> reality is something that happen in our days and happen because we have the tools for it, and people need to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to change our lives as much as the Internet and cell phones.
So how we get to the reality <unk>
The first step, is what I got <unk> Google <unk>
I'm sure that many people are familiar with them.
What you may not know is that the Google Google are a device that lets you see what I see it.
I'll allow them to experience what is being a professional <unk> in the field.
Now the only way to be in the field is that I tried to be <unk>
I have to use words.
I have to create a framework that you get <unk> with your imagination.
We can use the Google features under a <unk> and knowing what it is running by the field of game to 160 <unk> the blood <unk>
We can know that you feel that a man of 10 pounds -- we were going to be able to make it all of the <unk>
I've been there and I promise you that it's not quite nice.
<unk> some videos to show you what is to use the Google <unk> under the roof and give you a idea of it.
Unfortunately, they're not the images of the <unk> <unk> because the idea of the <unk> technology is a <unk> <unk> to the surface.
So let's see a video.
Chris <unk>
It's horrible to be <unk>
A moment is a little bit.
<unk>
Yeah.
Chris <unk> As you can see, it's a <unk> of what's going to be <unk> in the <unk> field from the perspective of <unk>
You have to realize that the rest of the team.
We have a video of the University of <unk> University.
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
Chris <unk> This is what a little bit more to be in the field, but it has nothing to see with being in the <unk>
<unk> want that experience.
<unk> want to be in the field, being their favorite players and they have asked me in YouTube and in <unk> you can see from the angle of a <unk>
or a <unk>
We want to experience that."
Once we have that experience with <unk> and Google Glass, how we get out of <unk> how we did the next <unk>
We take it to that level using something called <unk> <unk> that you probably have a lot of you know.
The <unk> <unk> has been described as the virtual reality virtual reality and it's not <unk>
And I'm going to teach you how to explain it with this video.
Man: Okay.
No, no, <unk> I don't want to keep <unk>
Oh, my God!
<unk> That's the experience of a man in a <unk> <unk> for his life.
What will be the experience of a human, when you take a video of <unk> <unk> <unk> the line, <unk> of a <unk> with the arm before the arm before they run and make a <unk>
And when I can be <unk> running by the <unk> <unk> the ball at the bottom of the <unk> or <unk> doing a <unk> in <unk>
What will be their experience when you get out of a mountain over 100 <unk> like a <unk> <unk>
Maybe you get the <unk> of <unk> for adults.
But this is not even <unk>
It is just a normal reality.
How did we make it <unk> <unk>
<unk> the reality is when the <unk> <unk> and the <unk> and the <unk> you see the information of what people want to see and say, "How do we use this to improve our <unk>
How do we use it to win <unk>
Because they always use technology to win.
I like to get them to you money.
So I've got a little bit about the technology in the <unk>
In the <unk> the <unk> <unk> they put a <unk> to their <unk> <unk> to get more fast.
They won the <unk> in that year.
Other teams decided <unk>
More people saw the <unk> because it was more <unk>
In 1994, the <unk> put it on the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> and after the <unk>
They had more <unk> because it was more fun.
In <unk> imagine that they're a player coming back to their group and you see its next <unk> you see in front of you, in a plastic <unk> that they take it to be <unk>
It or <unk> the strategy.
They just go into the field and <unk>
And the <unk> they want to be because if you don't get their legs they lose <unk> and they don't get to lose them to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to
If you lose <unk> <unk> as a <unk>
And they don't want to do that.
But the reality reality is not just a <unk>
The reality reality is also a way to take information and use it in real time to improve your <unk>
How do you do?
Well, a very simple choice would be having a camera in every corner of the stadium having a view of the people who is down.
You also get information of the sensors of the <unk> and <unk> something that it's already working on.
And all of that information is going to take your <unk>
The good teams will know <unk>
The bad will have a lot of human information.
This is <unk> to the good teams of the bad.
So your computer team will be as important as your <unk> and the analysis of data will stop being just for it.
It will be also to <unk> who would be <unk>
How would it be in the <unk>
Imagine that they're the <unk>
<unk> <unk> and <unk>
<unk> to a open receptor of a sudden, a <unk> on the left part of your Norden <unk> you know, that a sign behind you is going to be <unk> and the <unk> system is <unk>
And you get to the area of protection.
Another <unk> <unk> that there are a open network.
<unk> <unk> but <unk>
And the <unk> loses the trajectory.
You don't know where we test it, but the receptor looks in its Norden <unk> area that gets <unk> and can change the career.
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk>
The public <unk> and <unk> have followed it from each other.
This is something that create a massive excitement in the game.
So what many people do you see, because people want to live that experience.
<unk> want to be in the field.
They want to be your favorite show.
The reality is going to be part of the <unk> because it's too fast to not be.
But what I wonder is, we want this is the only use of reality <unk>
We're going to use only as bread and <unk> like our <unk>
Because I think we can use it for something more.
I think that we can use the reality <unk> to prevent the empathy between human beings, to show somebody how to be literally in the place of another person.
We know what this technology is worth for <unk>
It has thousands of millions of income per year.
But how much is this technology for a professor in the classroom trying to show you a <unk> how they are their actions from the perspective of <unk>
How much is this technology for a gay in Uganda or Russia trying to show you the world how they lives to be <unk>
How much it is also for a <unk> <unk> or <unk> <unk> <unk> trying to inspire a generation of children to think more in space and science instead of notes and <unk>
Ladies and gentlemen, the reality is <unk>
The questions that we do, the decisions that we took and the challenges that we face and the challenges that we face <unk>
Thank you.
Recently me after 23 years of 23 years in the <unk> <unk> of California.
Most of those 23 years of the country -- the end of the <unk> <unk> <unk> which includes the bridge <unk>
The bridge is a <unk> structure known by their beautiful number of San Francisco, the <unk> Street and its <unk>
Unfortunately, it's also a magnet for the <unk> being one of the more used in the world.
The bridge <unk> <unk> was opened in <unk>
Joseph <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> to build the bridge said that, "The bridge is basically a <unk> <unk>
<unk> from the bridge is not not complex and <unk>
But from the most of the most of the most of those people have been taught to their death from that bridge.
Some people think that to travel between the two <unk> the bridge has been <unk> as a <unk> as the each of the one of him would take it from all your origins and pain, and the water that they go underneath your soul.
But let me tell you that happens when the bridge is used to make it <unk>
After a half of four to five of five to five seconds, the body against the water about five miles per hour.
The invisible impact is the <unk> some of the ones that are the <unk> organs of the <unk>
Most of them in the impact.
The ones who not, they usually <unk> on the water <unk> and then they <unk>
I don't think that the ones that <unk> this way of <unk> you realize the <unk> <unk>
This is <unk>
Except around the two <unk> there are 32 inches of steel <unk> the bridge.
Here is where most people were going to take before the life.
I can tell you for the experience that one time the person is in that edge, and in the most dark time, it's very hard to bring them out of it.
I took this picture last year while this young guy talked about a <unk>
I want to tell you with sure that we had success that day in the <unk>
When I started working on the bridge, we didn't have any training training training.
<unk> to prevent the way through the way through these <unk>
This was not just a bad service to those who <unk> the <unk> but the government as well.
We've got a long way from then.
And today, Russia, Russia, and psychologists grow to the new <unk>
This is <unk> <unk>
I met the 22 percent of the year of the past year to get a call of a possible subject sitting in the <unk>
<unk> and when I got to read them to send them to send them with a <unk> <unk>
Frank had just 400 years and there was <unk> until the New Jersey.
In fact, there was <unk> until here two times before from New Jersey to try and <unk> from this bridge.
After close to a hour talking about <unk> we asked us if we knew the story of the box of the box of <unk>
<unk> the <unk> <unk> created to <unk> and the sent to the Earth with a box, and he said, "You know, I never turn that <unk>
Well, one day, the mistake could be more than <unk> and she opened the box.
He came up <unk> <unk> and all kinds of <unk> against the man.
The only good thing in the box was the hope.
And so she said, "What happens if you open the box and there's no <unk>
He stopped a couple of <unk> it took to the right-hand right-hand thing.
This guy kind of kind of <unk> of New Jersey I had had a life.
I talked to the parents of Daniel that night, and I guess when I was talking about them, they didn't seem to be a very good, because the day of the family was called me to see how I was.
The parents were <unk>
The damage will be the <unk> <unk> to many people.
I'm going to show you these questions. What do you do if a member of your family or a friend or somebody loved it was <unk>
What <unk>
<unk> what happened?
In my experience, it's not just to talk about, but you have to hear.
<unk> to understand.
Not <unk> <unk> or tell you to the person you know how to get it because it would probably not be <unk>
It just was there, you can be the point that you need to be the point that we need to need.
If you think somebody is <unk> no fear of <unk> and do the question.
A way to ask you the question is: <unk> in similar circumstances have thought in the end of your life.
<unk> to the person of the front of the person can save life and being the point of the <unk> to them.
Other signs of <unk> <unk> believe that things are <unk> and they never go to <unk> <unk> I believe that there is nothing that you can do in the <unk> social and a lot of interest in life.
I occurred to me this talk about a couple of days, and I got a friend of a lady and I'd like to show me his letter.
She lost his son the 19 of January of this year, and he wrote this email just a couple of days, and it's with her permission and <unk> that I read.
<unk> <unk> I guess you're in the TED.
It must be all a whole experience to be there.
I'm thinking that I should go back to the bridge this time.
I just wanted to give you a <unk>
I hope you can tell you a lot of people and go home talking about that to their friends who tell their friends, so on.
I'm still pretty <unk> but I put more times to realize that Mike I'm not going to go home.
Mike was <unk> in San Francisco to see the <unk> of the <unk> with her father with her father <unk>
They never come there.
I call the police <unk> and <unk> as the night.
On the morning of the next morning they came to my house, and I had been able to have been in the car of Mike was on the bridge.
<unk> had seen the <unk> from the bridge to the <unk> of the age of the age of the time.
Thank you very close to fight for those who can be <unk> too fast to fight themselves.
Who has not been before bad without having a real disease.
It shouldn't be so easy to end with it.
My <unk> are going to be one of you.
<unk> the <unk> <unk> <unk> is supposed to be a mouse through our beautiful <unk> not a <unk>
Good enough this week, <unk>
I can't imagine the value that she took to go to the bridge and go back to the way her son took that day, and also the value to go on.
I'd like to introduce you to a man that I mean, and value.
The 11 percent of 2005, I went to a phone called a <unk> <unk> in the <unk> of the bridge on the <unk> <unk>
<unk> my <unk> <unk> and I looked at this man, Kevin <unk> <unk>
When I looked at me <unk> the <unk> and they stopped in that small tube that goes around the <unk>
For the time and the average time I heard as Kevin talked about his depression and <unk>
Kevin decided to get back to that <unk> and give them to life again.
When Kevin <unk> <unk>
"This is a new <unk>
But I said, "What was what did it made it <unk> and they asked the hope and life and life.
And you know what I told me.
He said, "I <unk>
I stopped talking about and just <unk>
Shortly after that factory, I got a letter from the mother of <unk> and I have that letter with me and I'd like to <unk>
<unk> Mr. <unk> Nothing <unk> the events of 11 of 1900, and you're one of the reasons why Kevin is still with us.
I thought Kevin was <unk> for help.
It's been diagnosed with a mental disease to which has been <unk>
<unk> to Kevin when I only had six months of all those <unk> <unk> but thank God, now we know it.
Kevin is in order, as the <unk>
You give God for you.
I was in debt with you <unk> <unk>
And at the end of the end she said, <unk> <unk> when I went on the late University of San Francisco that night, you <unk> as the patient.
<unk> I had to be <unk>
Today, Kevin is a <unk> father and a active member of society.
Talk about the events about the events of that day and their depression with the hope that its story will inspire others.
<unk> is not just something that I've found in the work.
It's alive.
My grandfather <unk>
That <unk> despite the end of their own pain, I forgot the opportunity to say.
This is what the <unk>
For most people who are <unk> or those who think of the <unk> didn't think about <unk> to another person.
They just want your own <unk>
All of the general, this is just about three <unk> the drugs or alcohol or alcohol or women.
In my career, I've been born and I've been involved in hundreds of mental diseases and called carbon around the bridge.
From those incidents that I've been going to come up with a lot of two, but those two are too much.
You was <unk>
The other was a guy that I talked about a hour.
For that time, I <unk> your hand in three times.
In the end, I looked at the end, and he said, "You know, I said, "You know, I am sorry, but I have to me."
And <unk>
<unk> absolutely awful.
I want to tell you, yet the most people that the vast majority of people that we have to live in that bridge not <unk>
In addition, those few people who have been from the bridge and lived and that you can talk about it, that one one of those people have said that the second that they leave the side of the side of the <unk> that they realized that they had made a mistake and they wanted to live.
I tell the people, the bridge not only connects up with San Francisco, but they are also the people.
That connection, or the bridge that we do is something that all of us and every one of us should be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to do it.
<unk> can happen.
There's help. There's hope.
Thank you very much.
The world makes you to be what you don't are, but in your inside you know what you are, and a question you know, and a question you're going to be <unk>
I have to be something about that sense, but I'm not just in any way.
When I became a model I felt that I finally had a dream that had been from a girl.
My outside eventually <unk> with my real truth with my time.
So so much of the things that I'm going to bring me more later, when I look at this picture of it, you know, <unk> <unk> <unk>
But the past years, I discovered that <unk> I am excited about.
We were all <unk> our families, our religion, our society, our moment in history, even our bodies.
Some of them have the value of <unk> to get rid of the limitations of skin or the one of the skin of the skin or <unk>
These are people who always get the <unk> <unk> which is <unk>
In my case, the last nine years of my neighbors, many of my friends -- a lot of my friends -- my <unk> <unk>
I think this <unk> is <unk>
This is the mine.
I sold me as a <unk> at the <unk> of my <unk>
I remember my five years in the <unk> in my house, I always had to put this <unk>
And my mom asked me to say, "Why always you have that <unk> in the <unk>
I said, "It's my hair is a <unk>
I knew then how to <unk>
<unk> has always considered an fact -- but we now know that, actually, it's something more complex and <unk>
Because my success, I never got to share me to share my story, not because I thought that I am a bad thing, but why the world is to those of us who want to <unk>
All of the days, I thank you a woman.
I have friends, father and a family who take me as I am.
Many are not so lucky.
There's a long tradition in the culture of the culture of <unk> the mystery of <unk>
There's a <unk> of compassion.
There's a <unk> <unk> <unk>
And when I was eight years old, I was in a party in the United States that they take these <unk>
I was in front of the stage and remember that this beautiful woman came to me, and I remember that moment as if something is <unk> This is the kind of woman I would like to be.
And when I had 15 years old, when I was still a member of man, I met this woman called <unk>
It's the <unk> of a <unk>
And that night she asked me to me, "Why don't you have been involved in the competition of <unk>
He told me that if you <unk> it was the <unk> of the <unk> and the <unk> and that night, I won in the <unk> of <unk> I won in the <unk> of <unk> and he turned up in the <unk> of <unk>
That time changed my life.
And suddenly I was within the world of the <unk>
There are not a lot of people can say that his first job was <unk> in the beauty of women, but I can.
I met the <unk> of the <unk> on all of the time when we were <unk> in the <unk> of the <unk>
But most importantly, I met my best friends of that community.
In 2001 my mom.
I was <unk>
I told my mother, <unk> I'm <unk>
I'm here with friends, I like to travel and be an queen of <unk>
But then, two weeks later, I called me and said, "You know that if you <unk> the U.S. you can change the name and the identity of <unk>
It was all that I needed to hear.
My mom told me that I took two <unk> my name.
And she also taught me when I was going to be <unk> at the age of the age of 19, at the age of the age of 19, at the age of the age of 19,
It's curious that in some of the most of the most of the more than the most of the most of the most of the most of the most of the most of the most of the most of the more <unk> <unk> and <unk>
In that time, in the U.S., it was necessary to be able to be able to be able to be able to change the name of the <unk>
So in the 2001, I went to San Francisco, and I remember looking at the license of <unk> with the name of the name of <unk> and <unk> <unk>
It was a great time.
For a few people, their language of identity means to be able to drive or power to get a <unk> but for me was the license to live, to feel <unk>
As soon, my fears saw <unk>
I felt that I could thank my dream and I will go to New York, and to be model.
Many are not so lucky.
I think about this woman <unk> <unk> <unk>
A young woman in New York who <unk> living in the truth, but that <unk> put his life.
For many of my community, that is the reality that they live.
Our carbon rates are eight times more than the rest of the population.
All of the 20 of November we make a global <unk> for the <unk> <unk> <unk>
I'm in this stage because of a long story of people who <unk> and put them back to the <unk>
These are <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk>
Today, in this same time, I'm going to come out of the question.
I can't keep living my truth used and just for me.
I want to do the best to help the other people to live their truth without <unk>
I'm here, <unk> for some day there is no more <unk> of 20 <unk>
My greatest truth took me to accept what I am.
They're going to do that?
Thank you very much.
Thank you thank you thank you thank you thank you.  <unk> <unk> a quick question.
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> first at all my <unk>
I was going to get my childhood network to my parents -- which is very strong.
I remember all the times that I remember young women -- that I've been <unk> and a few times, when I was called me to me who their parents couldn't do it, I would call it to my parents and said, "Look, you can call this <unk>
Some times they wanted the other no. It's not just identity -- that's what it's in the center of what we are, right?
I mean, we all went to the <unk> to the <unk> and what I try to do is put on the table the subject that some times that was not going to be a space that was not going to be able to be a space that would be <unk> and this is a conversation that we should have to have parents, with colleagues.
The <unk> movement is <unk> compared to the gay movement.
There are still a lot of work to do.
It should be <unk>
It should be space for <unk> and to make questions, and I hope that all of you will be my thoughts.
KS: Thank you.
In a lot of clinical societies and <unk> the parents usually know about their kids, but I'm one of the few parents who are known for her daughter and I'm proud of it.
<unk> started their campaign for education to put their rights in Dr. and when they <unk> their efforts in 2011, by the <unk> the National <unk> <unk> was made very <unk> a small girl in the country.
Before that, was my daughter, but now I'm his father.
Ladies and gentlemen, if you <unk> a look at the story of humanity, the story of women is the story of the <unk> of violence and <unk>
You see, in the <unk> societies right from the beginning, when I turned up a child, his birth didn't be <unk>
It's not eating it not by his father, not by his mother.
The neighborhood <unk> day their <unk> and no no one of the father.
And a mother will get a lot for a girl.
When it gives light to the first child, the first daughter, you put it away.
When it gives light to the second daughter, <unk> and, with the hope of a son, when I <unk> his third daughter, feels guilty like a <unk>
Not only the gay mother but the daughter. The daughter just <unk> when it feels as well.
At the age of five years ago, when I should go to school, it gets on home and the school went down to their <unk>
Until the age of 12 years in a certain way, has a good life.
You can <unk>
It can play with their friends on the street, and you can move around the streets as a <unk>
But when you go on the <unk> when it comes 13 years old, you get it to come out of his house without a <unk>
It's <unk> the four walls of his house.
It's not a free person.
It turns out in the honor of his father and their brothers and their brothers and the <unk> and if you <unk> the code of the course of course we could even kill it.
And it's interesting that this course of course is not just the life of a <unk> it also affects the life of a <unk> it also affects the life of the family.
So this brother, <unk> the <unk> of their life and happiness happiness in the name of the course in the name of course.
And there is a more <unk> <unk> which is called <unk>
It's supposed to a good girl must be very <unk> and very <unk>
It's <unk>
The model of a good girl must be <unk>
It is supposed to be <unk> and it turns out the decisions of their father and their mother and the decisions of the <unk> even if you don't know.
If the <unk> with a man who don't like or if the <unk> with a man who has <unk> because it doesn't want to be <unk> <unk>
If the <unk> very young, you have to do it.
Otherwise, <unk> <unk>
And what happens to it.
In words of a <unk> <unk> <unk> and then it gives light to more children and <unk>
And the irony of the situation is that this mother, <unk> the same lesson of <unk> to his daughter and the same lesson of honor their children.
And this particular circle goes on and it goes on.
<unk> brothers and sisters when I was born <unk> and for the first time, I think I don't like the only <unk> to be honest, but when I was there, and I looked at your eyes, feel pretty <unk>
And so much before I <unk> I thought about her name, and I was fascinated with a <unk> <unk> of the freedom in Afghanistan.
Your name was <unk> <unk> and called my daughter for it.
But when I <unk> all of the men, and I took my <unk> and <unk> a line of my name, and <unk> <unk>
And when she <unk> when I had four years and a half years and a half years ago in my school.
I mean, why I have to mention the <unk> of a girl in a school?
Yeah, I have <unk>
You can give you in Canada, in Canada, in the United States, in the United States, in the United States, in the United States, in the United States, in many countries, but in the poor countries, in the poor countries, in the <unk> societies is a great event for the life.
<unk> in a school means the health of your identity and his name.
One of the school means that has in the world of dreams and the ants where you can explore their potential for their life.
I have five babies, and no of them could go to school, and they would be <unk> two weeks earlier, when I <unk> the <unk> <unk> and I was in the part of the family, I couldn't remember the <unk> of some of my sisters.
And the reason was that I had never seen the names of my <unk> <unk> in any <unk>
That was the reason for my daughter.
What my father was not able to give my sisters and I thought I had to change it.
I used to appreciate the intelligence and the <unk> of my daughter.
The <unk> to sit with me when my friends came to it.
<unk> to go with me to a different <unk>
And all of these values, I've tried to focus on their personality.
And this wasn't just for it, just for <unk>
I've got all these good values in my school girls and children for the same.
I used education to <unk>
I took my streets, taught the students to forget the lesson of the <unk>
They taught the students to forget the lesson of the called <unk>
<unk> brothers and sisters <unk> over the women, and <unk> to have more and more space for women in society.
But we found it with a new.
It was <unk> for human rights and in particular, for the rights rights.
It's called <unk>
That means a whole set of the participation of women in all of the women in all of the economic activities and social activities and social activities and social activities and social activities and social activities and social and social activities and social activities and social activities and social activities and social activities and social activities and social activities and social activities and social activities and social activities and social
Hundreds of schools were getting together.
They were going to get them to the school.
The women were forced to use <unk> and they stopped the <unk>
The musicians were <unk> the girls <unk> and <unk>
<unk> million, but a few <unk> and it was optimistic to have around those people who kill and <unk> when you talk about their rights.
It's really cool.
At the 10 years of the 10 years ago, I got it up with the right to education.
He wrote a paper for the blog of the <unk> he gave it the same for the <unk> of the New York Times, and I talked about every platform that they can.
And his voice was the most powerful voice to be the more powerful voice.
It was <unk> as a <unk> around the world.
And that was the reason that the Taliban couldn't tolerate his campaign and the nine of October of 2012, they were born to <unk> in the head.
It was a day <unk> for my family and for me.
The world became a big black hole.
As my daughter was <unk> between the life and death, <unk> the ear to my <unk> <unk> <unk> why I spent my daughter, to your <unk>
And <unk> told me <unk> please don't be <unk>
<unk> <unk>
<unk> your life in play, by the cause of the reason for the cause of peace, and by the cause of education, and by the cause of education, and your daughter was inspired to you and you get it.
They both were in the right way and God <unk>
So these few words <unk> a lot for me, and I didn't go back again.
When I was <unk> I was in the hospital and I had <unk> <unk> and the <unk> <unk> I was <unk> I used to see a dark shadow that was <unk> by the face of my wife.
But my daughter never <unk>
I used <unk> "I'm good with my smile <unk> and with the <unk> in my face.
I'm going to put me, please don't be <unk>
It was a little bit for us, and we have <unk>
<unk> brothers and sisters we've learned about it how to communicate in the most difficult moments and I'm going to share with you who even even though if you be an icon for the rights rights and women, it's like any girl from 16 years.
<unk> when not just your task.
They fight their siblings, and I'm very happy for that.
People ask me, "What are a special special in my <unk> which has made that <unk> <unk> and <unk>
I mean, I don't wonder what I did.
<unk> what I didn't do.
I didn't cut their wings and that's it.
Thank you very much.
Thank you. Thank you very much.
I was <unk> the brain about 18 years ago, and since that day, the science of the brain has become a personal passion.
I'm engineering.
And I want to tell you that recently I've gotten the <unk> group of Google, where I've had a <unk> to my <unk> the <unk> of Google <unk> but all the work that we talk today about the science of the brain, I did before I took Google or outside my job there.
So we said this, there is a <unk> when you give you a <unk>
It's still kind of kind of smart or right?
It will not be like this, you can be <unk>
After the <unk> I took me a part of the brain, and I had to live with it.
It wasn't the <unk> matter but it was the <unk> part of the center that creates important and <unk>
And then I took it after the year, I had to decide what many of the most of a dozen <unk> chemicals every day, because if you didn't take anything, I would go in a few hours.
Every day, for the past 18 years, I've had to decide about the combinations and <unk> <unk> and try to get <unk> to keep life.
More than I've saved me for it.
But luckily, I have a soul soul for what I decided to be <unk> to try to get the dose of <unk> that it really doesn't exist a clear map that you say in <unk>
I started trying to test with different <unk> and he turned up to see how small changes in the dose of the <unk> <unk> my sense who was me, my sense of who was me, my behavior with others.
A particularly particularly <unk> for a few months ago, I took the dose and chemical chemicals for a man of <unk> and I was made to see how to take my thoughts.
I was always <unk> I thought all the time in the sex, and I thought it was the most dangerous person around the world, and --  of course, many times in the past I've met several types of guys like this, or maybe some versions of <unk>
It turned out as a end.
But my great surprise was that I wasn't trying to be <unk>
In fact, I was <unk> a very <unk> and a problem that I had to the front, and just not happen like that.
So I couldn't do it.
I changed my <unk>
But I think that that experience gave me a new <unk> about men and about what they have to <unk> since the men.
What it was trying to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to get up and <unk> and you know, it was <unk> my intelligence after disease and <unk> my creative thought of ideas.
<unk> to think about the images, and that became my <unk> point how to be able to make those mental images that use to create <unk> my ideas, if you get <unk> <unk> new ideas and <unk>
This kind of business is not new.
<unk> like <unk> <unk> and <unk> you look at things like that.
It thought that the images and natural ideas were the same thing.
Today, there are those people who look at this idea, and there are a lot of discussions about how the mind.
So after several years ago, I can find the point right and I have a lot of great <unk> <unk> -- really <unk> <unk> and <unk>
Now, I'm working on how to take it fast these images of my mind to the screen of the computer.
You imagine what if a director of film was able to use their imagination and just to lead to the world that has to the <unk>
Or if a small musician could extract the music.
There's incredible possibilities with this, as the way people can get to share the speed of light.
And the truth is that, the only difficulty to achieve this is just increase the energy of our brain systems.
Let me show you why I think we are pretty close to get to this with two recent experiments in neuroscience.
They both used technology to be able to be able to be able to be able to represent the brain here, you can see the brain of brain made by <unk> <unk> and their colleagues in Harvard.
The column of the left shows the <unk> of a person that look at a picture.
The column of the middle shows the <unk> of the brain of that same individual as they <unk> it on the same image.
The column of the right was created <unk> the content of the central column of the left, you see that the difference is almost <unk>
And this is <unk> in many different individuals with a lot of different images.
The difference between seeing a picture and imagine that same image is almost <unk>
Now, let me share the other experiment. This is the laboratory of Jack <unk> <unk> California.
They put them to turn the brain waves in visual fields in <unk>
We look at this way.
In this experiment, I showed people hundreds of hours of extra videos as they <unk> their brains to create a huge number of chemical reactions in the <unk>
And then I showed you a film with images with new images with new animals, and as well as a new <unk>
The computer, using only the brain information of the <unk> <unk> to show what it seemed to show what the person was seeing.
On the right-hand side, you can see the <unk> of the computer, and the video that I showed you.
This allowed us <unk>
We're just close to it.
We just need to improve the <unk>
And now you remember that when you see a picture and when you see that same image, it creates in the brain the same <unk>
This took it with the <unk> systems of more effective systems today, and its <unk> are being used as a thousand times in the past years.
And now we need to increase the <unk> about a few times more to get a more <unk>
How do it <unk>
There are a lot of techniques to do it.
One is to open the skull and you get to introduce you it.
I don't tell me for that.
A lot of people are talking about new techniques of <unk> by images, even I loved them with the recent result of the <unk> first we need to ask the next thing that technology is the end of the <unk>
The conventional wisdom says that the only way that the only way that the only way to get more <unk> is with the biggest <unk> but at this point, the more <unk> only is just a small <unk> in the <unk> not <unk> for thousands as we need.
I propose this idea, instead of the most big, <unk> we do better <unk>
We can create a lot more complex structures with a slightly different bit like doing a <unk>
And why do we do this <unk>
In the past years, a great amount of effort in the <unk> they were to make a really big, <unk> right?
However, most of the recent advances in <unk> and brilliant solutions in <unk> and <unk> in <unk> and <unk> in the <unk> and <unk> <unk>
On the time, instead of a magnetic magnetic field -- <unk> patterns and <unk> patterns of <unk> <unk>
So the combine the magnetic patterns with the patterns of the <unk> <unk> patterns we can increase the data of the information that you can extract in a single <unk>
In addition, we can take in <unk> our growing knowledge about the structure of the brain and memory to create the increase in the thousands of thousands that we need.
When we use the <unk> we should be able to measure it not just the <unk> <unk> but the <unk> and <unk> that I've talked about, and perhaps even the structural activity to build this is the dream.
We can be able to build our ideas in a direct way to digital media.
You imagine if we could go on on the language and communicate directly through the <unk>
What would we be <unk>
And how to try to deal with the truths of human thinking without <unk>
You thought the Internet is a big thing.
These are great questions.
It would be <unk> as a tool to make our skills of thinking and communication.
They're going to be able to be able to take the cure of the <unk> and diseases as well.
We have a few choices more than open this door.
All ways, we choose a year, going to happen in five or 15 years?
It's hard to imagine that to take a lot more.
We have to learn how to give this step together.
Thank you.
I'm going to talk about this night about coming out of the <unk> and not just the traditional sense, not only the <unk>
I think we all have <unk>
Your quest is probably telling some person for the first time that I love or tell somebody who is <unk> or tell somebody who has cancer, or any other conversation that you have been inspired in life.
All of them is a hard, conversation and even though our issues can change the experience of the living experience and have gone out of that <unk> is something <unk>
<unk> and we don't like it and it must happen.
A few years ago, I worked in the South East <unk> <unk> a restaurant, in the city, and it was there, I had to go through a bunch of the intensity of the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> as a <unk>
And I will be <unk> that for the <unk> of my short <unk> and I had <unk> the head -- I was asking me to ask me, you know, a boy <unk> "Hey, you're taught or <unk>
And it took a uncomfortable silence in the table.
<unk> my house a little bit more, I would take me my coffee with a <unk>
The father <unk> <unk> the newspaper and the mother went on a cold, look at her child.
But I would not say anything, and <unk> in it.
And I got to the point that every time I was going to be a kid between three and 10 years ago, I was ready to be ready to win.
And that's a terrible thing.
So I promised me that the next time I would say something.
You have that conversation hard.
So after a few weeks, I came back again.
They're a boy or a <unk>
A familiar silence but this time I was <unk> and I was going to go back on the <unk> issues on the table --  I had <unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk>
Even a bunch of the <unk> <unk> that <unk>
And so they put it <unk> and I went on the <unk> and my <unk> a little girl of four years ago with a dress of <unk> <unk> -- which is not a challenge for a <unk> <unk> just a girl with a question: "You're a girl or <unk>
And so they made it <unk> again, I put them out of it, and I said, "Hey, I know this is something <unk>
I have the short hair like the one of a boy and seen clothes, but I am a girl, and you know, as you like you like you like you like you like to use a <unk> and sometimes you like to use a <unk>
Because I am more of the guy of a <unk> <unk>
And that girl looked at me -- paying attention, and he said, "My favorite <unk> is <unk> and it has a fish.
You can give you a <unk> <unk>
And that was all right. "Oh, you have a girl.
What about the <unk> that <unk>
It was the most easy conversation about all that I had ever had.
And by <unk> because the girl of the <unk> and I, both we were <unk> the one with the other.
So as many of us, I've lived in some of us, in some of us, in my life, and yeah, my walls used to be a <unk>
But in the darkness, you can't know what color is the walls.
You know how a job feels living in a question.
It's like my <unk> is not different to you or the one of them.
<unk> will give you 100 reasons of why you get out of my <unk> was more hard to get out of your life, but this is the <unk> it is hard to be <unk>
The hard is hard.
Who can tell me to explain somebody who have <unk> in <unk> it's more hard to say that has been <unk>
Who can tell me that this story is harder to tell your son of five years that you're going to <unk>
There is no more hard, it only exists the hard.
We need to leave us what it is hard to be hard to be hard to be able to make them better or worst in relationship to our <unk> and we have just feel empathy because we all live something difficult.
In some point in our lives, we all live in <unk> and you can make them feel security, or at least more safety than the other side of the door.
But I'm here to tell you that it doesn't matter what they are made their heart <unk> not a place to live.
Thank you.  Imagine the same 20 years ago.
And I had a <unk> tail a head and <unk> <unk>
I was not the <unk> <unk> to fight against any boy from four years that will go to the coffee.
I was <unk> by fear, <unk> in a corner of my dark <unk> my head and the move only a muscle is the most likely that ever ever ever made.
My family, my young friends that I've been past my entire life, trying to not <unk> and now the world was going back to purpose.
I was going to bring the pages of a question that we all have been known for so long time, but if you don't get them to that <unk>
One of my <unk> <unk> was in the best of my mom.
It was the first time that many of the <unk> knew that I was gay, and to do my <unk> of <unk> in my black wife, and <unk> walked around the <unk> and I finally went to one where the friends of my parents, people who knew I knew I was years.
And after talking about a moment, one of the women -- <unk> <unk> <unk>
And the battle of the gay study.
<unk> some time they had in the <unk>
"Well, yeah, the truth is that we have friends in San <unk>
"Well, we've never been there, but we've heard that it's <unk>
<unk> you know my <unk> <unk>
It's very good and never talked about having <unk>
<unk> what is your TV program.
Our program is <unk> <unk>
And you know who <unk> <unk>
Jack is our <unk>
And then a woman, <unk> but in addition to show you to show your attention to be able to know that I was from my hand, he finally said, "Well, sometimes my husband uses <unk>
And I had an opportunity at that time, as the same is all the <unk> <unk>
<unk> could be easy to argue where they felt <unk>
It's not very hard to remember and you realize the fact that they were <unk>
And what else you can ask somebody, but <unk>
If you're going to be true with somebody, you have to be prepared to be prepared to be prepared for the actual <unk>
It's like the hard conversations are still being my strong.
Tell any of those who I have been <unk>
But I'm going to be able to call the three principles of the <unk> of the <unk>
Now, please look at this through the gay perspective, but you understand what it means to get out of any <unk> is essentially the same.
Number one: Be <unk>
<unk> <unk> Okay.
That girl in the coffee had no <unk> but I was ready for the battlefield.
If you want somebody to be <unk> the other you need to know that we also do it.
Number two: <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
If you know they're gay, <unk>
If you tell their parents that maybe you might be gay, they would be able to get the hope that that could change.
They don't give them a sense of <unk> hope.
And number three, and more important and more importantly,  Let me the complex way.
You communicate your truth.
It would never get them for it.
And some of you can go out of <unk> <unk> <unk> so they have done, but they never feel what they are.
And yeah, maybe some of you can feel <unk> but that something in them.
Those are the expectations of them about what you are, but not the <unk>
That's the story of them.
The only story that matters is what you want to walk.
So the next time you find in a dark <unk> <unk> a <unk> must know that we all have been there before.
And you can feel very <unk> but they don't are.
Thank you, <unk> <unk> <unk>
<unk> what is that?
If we look at the story of how you look at the intelligence -- an example has been the famous quote of <unk> <unk> that the question of if a machine can think is so interesting as the question if you can be <unk>
When I <unk> <unk> wrote this as a matter of <unk> as Frank <unk>
And so a few years ago, you get a program to try to understand the physical mechanisms of intelligence.
Let's take a step.
We start with a mental experiment with a mental experiment.
Imagine that they're from a <unk> race who don't know anything about biology of the Earth -- no neuroscience of the Earth -- and the intelligence of the Earth Earth, but they have a incredible new lives and you can look at the Earth, and they have a incredibly long lives so you can look at the Earth for million, even thousands of years.
And you see a very strange effect.
Of course, as we <unk> we know that the reason would be that we are trying to save ourselves.
We're trying to avoid a impact.
But if they're from a <unk> race who don't know anything about this, which doesn't have any concept about intelligence intelligence -- you can actually forced to develop a physical theory, which is how much time in the time, the <unk> that <unk> the surface of a planet <unk>
And that's why I say this is the same question that we understand the physical nature of intelligence.
So in this program that took a bunch of years ago, I did a variety of issues through science, through a variety of issues that <unk> I think, to a only set of intelligence.
In <unk> for example, for instance, has been a variety of evidence that our universe seems to be able to be able to be <unk> <unk> for the development of intelligence, and in particular, for the development of the states of the possible population.
And then eventually in the <unk> of <unk> has been a variety of techniques that have tried to take the skills of the robots to maximize the future freedom to maximize the future of the end of the time of making common properties.
And so taking all these different different issues and <unk> together, since a whole number of years ago, there is a underlying mechanism for intelligence that we can extract from all these different <unk>
There's just a equation for <unk>
And I think the answer is yes. What are you seeing is probably the equivalent of the most close to a <unk> and <unk> <unk> for the intelligence that I have seen it.
So what you're seeing here is a claim that the intelligence is a <unk> <unk> that it acts with the end of maximize the future freedom of action.
<unk> to maximize the future freedom of action, or to keep the expensive choices with a gun force with the diversity of possible the diversity of possible <unk> Yeah, Yeah, until a <unk> time.
In a few words, the intelligence don't like to be <unk>
The intelligence is trying to maximize the future freedom of action and keep the genetic devices.
And so having to realize this is a <unk> -- what can you do with this?
What's so <unk> right?
<unk> the human intelligence.
<unk> <unk>
So I'm going to show you now a video I think, to show some of the amazing applications of this simple equation.
Narrator: <unk> research in Nairobi have been told that the <unk> that they produce more <unk> or <unk> for their life, they should have tendency to be more effective conditions for the existence of things like us.
But what happens if that connection <unk> <unk> between the diseases and intelligence <unk> a more <unk>
What happens if the intelligent behavior is not just a <unk> with the production of education to the long term, but that actually comes directly to it.
To find it <unk> we have developed a software of software called <unk> designed to maximize the production of diseases in any system in the system that you can be able to be in it.
<unk> <unk> could happen many multiple evidence of intelligence games can play games and even win money -- and all that they have been wrong to do it.
Here's some examples of <unk> in action.
As a human foot foot on the <unk> here we look at <unk> <unk> <unk> a <unk> using a <unk>
This behavior is remarkable in part because we never realized a <unk>
He would just decided for her to balance the <unk>
This ability to balance is to have applications for the <unk> <unk> and technologies of human beings.
This ability to use the tools will have to have applications and agriculture.
In the same as some other animals can eat <unk> of the <unk> of a <unk> at the same time to take the food, here to take the food, here we can make a version of the model of that task.
This capacity of cooperation has important important important to the economic and a variety of other languages.
<unk> is <unk> <unk> a variety of <unk>
For example, here we see the <unk> to play a game of <unk> against the same, <unk> their potential to play.
So here we see <unk> to make new connections in a social network where the friends are constantly constantly constantly and connected to the success the network of the <unk>
This same capacity of <unk> also has applications in health care of health, and intelligence.
So here we look at <unk> to organize the consumption of a <unk> <unk> <unk> with success and using the idea of <unk> to expand into the global level of the <unk>
In the same way, it <unk> is dangerous, <unk> and <unk> problems and transportation.
And then then we see here we look at <unk> you can find out and a strategy of <unk> <unk> in a series of <unk> <unk> in a series of <unk> in a series of <unk> in a series of <unk> <unk>
This ability to increase the risk will have a huge applications in the <unk> and in all.
Alex <unk> what you've seen is that a variety of different religious behaviors such as the use of tools, and the use of tools, all of the tools, to walk up and social cooperation all of a used to maximize their future freedom of action.
Now, here's a profound <unk>
So let's go back to the beginning of the term of the term <unk> the work <unk> there was always the concept that if we <unk> machines would be a <unk> <unk>
The machines are <unk> against us.
One of the biggest implications of this work is that maybe all of these decades, we've had all the concept of <unk> <unk> to <unk>
It's not that the first things they become smart and then <unk> and you try to make them over the world.
It's all the contrary, that you have to take the control of all the future of all the future possible is a more fundamental principle that the intelligence can also actually be able to be able to take the control, instead of being the right time.
Another consequence consequence is the pursuit of the goal.
I often say, how is you to look at the goals they get out of this kind of <unk>
My equivalent to that <unk> to go to the descendants of the descendants to help them build <unk> <unk> or to help us understand human intelligence -- is the this: intelligence must be view as a physical process that tries to maximize the future freedom of action and avoid the fields in their own future.
Thank you very much.
We are in a <unk> point in human history, something between the <unk> of stars and lose the planet that we call <unk>
From the last years, we have created a lot of our knowledge of how the Earth is the Earth in the context of the universe.
The <unk> mission has discovered thousands of possible planets that kills around other stars, which is not just one of the thousands of millions of planets from our galaxy.
<unk> is a space <unk> which is the <unk> <unk> of the stars when the planets go around in front of them, and it turns out a little bit of that light that we do.
The data came on the <unk> show the <unk> of the planets in the distance that there are between them and their mother.
In <unk> this helps us to understand if these planets are small and <unk> as the speed of our solar system and also the amount of light that they get out of their own.
At the time, this day is about if these planets that we found is <unk> or not.
Unfortunately, while we're finding this <unk> of complex worlds that our own planet is <unk> under the weight of humanity.
Last year was the more <unk>
<unk> and ice ice who have been with us from us from the <unk> now now in a matter of decades.
And these political changes that we have led to global scale have been able to change our ability to change their question.
But I'm not not a scientist of the food or <unk>
But I study the <unk> of the planet with the stars, with the hope of finding places in the universe where we find life beyond our planet.
You might say that this is looking for opportunities in the <unk> sector.
Now, as somebody very interested in the pursuit of life in the universe I can say that the more <unk> planets similar to Earth, more than our own planet.
Every one of these new worlds is going to be a comparison between the world between the world in the planet and the planets that we know the best, of our solar system.
Let's take our neighbor, Mars.
Mars is small and <unk> and despite being a little bit over the sun, it can be a little bit more far from the sun, it can be able to be able to be able to be a mission as the <unk>
In fact, it is possible that Mars has been <unk> in the past and the part, it's why we studied so many of Mars.
Our <unk> as the <unk> <unk> the surface of the <unk> about the origins of life -- as we know it.
The satellites that the <unk> as the <unk> <unk> take samples from the atmosphere and try to understand how Mars has been able to lose their <unk>
The private companies are now not just small <unk> in the food -- but also the chance to live in Mars.
But despite all these images that all of these images are giving us to remember the <unk> of our planet where they're involved in our imagination with the ideas with the ideas and <unk> ideas with the Earth, Mars is a pretty terrible place to live.
Let's take the extension of the <unk> areas of our planet that they still get by <unk> places in comparison with Mars.
Even in the more <unk> places of the Earth -- and the air of the Earth is a little bit of oxygen and full of oxygen <unk> around our DNA forests in thousands of miles away.
I worry that this <unk> for the <unk> of Mars and other planets to be able to be a big and sad and sad and the belief of some of some that Mars and the belief of some of some of the planet that we know that it's really <unk> the Earth.
For a lot of you like the exploration -- I am in deep to get this idea.
There are a lot of good reasons to go to Mars but to say that Mars will be there to make humanity to humanity is like imagine that the captain of the <unk> is how to imagine that the captain of truth will have a place more late in the <unk>
But the goals for the exploration of <unk> and <unk> <unk>
No, they actually are the face of the same <unk> the goal of trying to preserve and improve life in the future.
The <unk> environments in our world looks like <unk>
I just find more close to home.
If we can understand how to create and keep the <unk> spaces, in the <unk> areas in the land, maybe we can meet the need to preserve our environment and go beyond it.
I'll leave you with a <unk> experiment the paradox of <unk>
A lot of years ago, the physical physics, I asked him, I realized that our universe has been a long time, and we hope that there were a lot of planets in this universe, we should have found evidence from the existence of life in life to right now.
Well, where do we go.
Well, a possible solution to the paradox of <unk> is that when the civilizations are getting enough enough to be able to keep living between the stars, and they lose the notion of what's important that is to protect this development.
It's <unk> to think that just the <unk> we will save us to save ourselves and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> we can work together.
If we really believe in our ability to take the <unk> environments of Mars for the human presence so we should be able to overcome the most easy task to preserve the <unk> on Earth.
Thank you.
I was a few years ago, I got my own house.
And as I was in the front of the front of the front of the front of the <unk> I realized that I didn't have the <unk>
In fact, I could see the window that they were on the table of the <unk> where the <unk>
So fast I tried to open all of the other doors and <unk> and all of them were still <unk>
I thought I was going to call a <unk> at least I had my phone, but the <unk> a <unk> could take a lot of time in it, and I did too fast and it was cold.
I could not go back to my friend of Jeff to move night because I had an early flight to Europe at the morning and I <unk> my <unk> and my <unk>
<unk> expensive, but sure that they're not more expensive than a <unk> at half night, so I thought, that despite the though the though the though the <unk>
I am <unk> and I know a little bit about how the brain works.
<unk> <unk> which is the rate of the <unk> <unk> <unk> levels and <unk> the <unk>
And when I got to the <unk> <unk> in the airport, I realized that I didn't have my skin.
Well, I had a lot of time to think about those eight hours without sleep.
And I started asking me, if there was something that I could be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to put it in your place, which would be <unk>
Or at least if you look at least if you get good things that you can take the likelihood of the likelihood that is a <unk>
So I put me to think about that, but until a month after my thoughts was not <unk>
I was having with my colleague Danny <unk> <unk> <unk> and a little bit, I talked about that I went on the window, and he had been known to me that I went on the window, and I call me to me that I had been done something called <unk> <unk>
It's something that he had learned from the psychologist Gary <unk> who had written from this about a few years before, known as the <unk>
They all know what's the <unk>
Every time there is a <unk> a team of experts comes and tries to find what it was wrong, right?
In the <unk> as it explains <unk> you look at it, and trying to find all the things that you could go wrong, and then you try to figure out what can do to help you get to help things like or to minimize the harm.
So what I want to talk about you is about some things that we can do in the way of a <unk>
Some of them are <unk> others are not so impressive.
I'm going to start with the <unk>
And in the house, you get a place for things that they lose very easily.
This sounds kind of sense of common sense, but there are a lot of science that are going on this <unk> based on how our global memory works.
There is a structure in the brain called <unk> which has evolved over thousands of years to make a <unk> of the location of things -- where it's the well, where they are the fish, where the trees are <unk> where the trees are living and <unk>
<unk> is the part of the brain that <unk> in the <unk> of London.
It's the part of the brain that lets the <unk> to find their <unk>
And if you ask you if somebody really made the experiment, you put the sense of the <unk> and they still could be able to find their <unk>
They didn't use the <unk> but the hippocampus, that mechanism really evolved the brain to find things.
But it's really good for things that they don't move a lot of things that they move a lot.
This is the reason to lose the car, and <unk> and <unk>
So in home <unk> a place for <unk> a <unk> along the door, maybe a <unk>
And for their <unk> a particular difference?
For their <unk> <unk> a particular <unk>
If you <unk> a place and they're <unk> with that their things will always be there, when the <unk>
What about the <unk>
Take with the cell phone a picture of their <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> for email to be in the cloud.
If these things are lost or the <unk> this can make the <unk>
These are some of the most amazing things.
Remember, when it is under stress, the brain is <unk>
<unk> is <unk> and <unk>
